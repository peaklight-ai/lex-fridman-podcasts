announced at places like Tacoma and Portland and San Francisco very very soon enjoy the episode ladies and gentlemen welcome to the Tim Dillon show we are going to be a Monday show we are uploading uh today Tuesday uh because we got back late from Arizona where we did a bunch of shows sold them out in Phoenix and Tucson I think Tucson was sold out we were close um thanks to everybody who came out it was a lot of fun I I spent almost a week there in the desert and uh I like Arizona I like it because it's a state that is evenly divided between uh retirees and Psychopaths um those are the two largest demographic groups in Arizona people that are retired and people who are psychotic and that's a fun mix because there's one side constantly trying to drag some of the people into their side like the Psychopaths they get a few of the retirees to come on to their side they pull them it's like that thing in gym where you tug a war and you try to pull people uh and the Psychopaths occasionally will pull some of the retirees and then some of the retirees will pull some of the Psychopaths and just be like hey man how about just chill how about just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] swing a golf club um but it's that natural tension between retiree and psychopath which is what the desert is that's the whole desert but it was a lot of fun there we enjoyed ourselves we are now the official podcast sponsor of the Ukraine war this is something that I'm very excited about we beat out um a lot of the other podcasts we beat out my favorite murder we beat that last podcast on the left we beat out uh the girls got to eat dude the girls that sling the vibrators uh we beat them uh to be the official sponsor of the Ukraine war we are the show that sponsors the Ukraine war as a podcast now that doesn't mean we wanted to keep going just because we are these official sponsor of the Ukraine war we don't want it to keep going however as long as it does keep going uh we do realize that war can be beautiful and teach us beautiful things about ourselves and the world around us um and that makes us the official sponsor of uh the Ukraine war as a podcast uh similar to America who's sponsoring the Ukraine war but doesn't want it to keep going but if it does if it happens to uh it should be um beautiful our president remember when this started a year ago the Ukraine war remember about a year ago the Ukraine war started Russia invaded the Ukraine and the idea was that there would be some type of push for peace that this would end or someone would want this to end um and that has not been the case we are now a year in and uh you know now we're saying like Biden's gone out and said like Russia will never win in Ukraine so it's the American position that Russia has to lose which is uh I understand why that's the Ukrainian position but it's the American position now that Russia has to lose which is different from the American position saying we would like peace peace would mean or you would think it would mean that both countries made some arrangement agreement and that the fighting War would cease um there'd be a treaty we know it how this works but now President Biden has come out and said uh there will be no victory for Russia in Ukraine Russia will never win which of course means that Russia will lose and then he made a surprise visit to the capital uh on Monday and he was like it was very secretive and sexy and because the whole thing with Biden now is because he's old and he's kind of enfeebled and he he doesn't know how to speak they have to dress him up as he's like a tough guy and he's tough and it's like he doesn't give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and you know look at him walking next to Solinski and you know it's like Mr Biden arrived early Monday morning to meet with President zielinski this is the New York Times after a 10-hour overnight train ride which he slept through probably um but the two stepped out into the streets of Kiev even as an air raid siren sounded a dramatic moment that underscored the investment the United States has made in the Ukraine's independence by the way it's clear they want Biden dead like the people like the people that are worried that he may not be a good candidate they're like yeah yeah you go over there show your support walk around in the street you and zelinsky make out whatever you have to do make sure you're into public make sure you see a bunch of people um Biden was there for only five hours uh and he promised to release another 500 million in military aid in coming days 500 million uh dollars now the Ukraine wants some real deal arms because Ukraine is now saying we want to go into Red Square we want to push into Russia you know we want to bring down the regime in Russia uh Russia is now pulled out of a nuclear proliferation treaty uh with us symbolic for sure who knows not the treaties keep people from doing anything they want to do anyway um but you know this is It's become a uh incredibly and it's sad that anybody is dying right so we all feel bad for any civilian in the Ukraine that has been killed anybody in Russia that has been drafted in to go fight this war we feel bad for anybody that's life is being thrown into the abyss you're throwing these people's lives uh into this black hole um but you know now now we are basically saying like we're in we like it we like it the idea that we don't like the Ukraine war has to be destroyed we love it we have a war of white people in which we can throw hundreds of billions maybe more at we enjoy it we like it it's good for the weapons industry it's good for our uh by the way what else are we going to talk about the trains that keep derailing with the poison we don't want to do that we're going to talk about the kids in Ohio who are being refused lunch we're going to talk about that later but what do we what do we really have to say we like talking about the Ukraine war it's good for our country to take the focus off of the things that we don't really love about what's happening in our country and put it on the Ukraine um and we kind of like it's a it's a fun Pastime right now it's like sports the Super Bowl's over so this is kind of the new thing this is another article here uh in the New York Times which the New York Times is now the official like U.S prom it's always been but like specifically for this war um very exciting very exciting here not peace mind you not steps towards peace um in the in the New York Times some of the best weapons in the world are now in Ukraine they may change the war so we're now celebrating the Weaponry that we send not not any steps towards any type of agreement that would stop fighting tens of billions of dollars of weapons have flowed from Europe and North American countries into the Ukraine rifles bullets missiles artillery yeah baby at first the Nations insisted that the weapons were defensive designed to help the Ukraine fight off The Invasion one year later as The Battered but still potent Russian military prepares for a renewed offensive the type of weapons heading into Ukraine have changed dramatically now they're getting the good stuff now they're getting the stuff that they've kind of always wanted the distinction my my favorite uh line here the distinction between offensive and defensive weapons was always a little bit arbitrary it's a little bit arbitrary it doesn't really matter what we're giving them are we giving them things to defend themselves or to keep this going or to push in to expand the scope of the war we don't know we're just giving them fun stuff and they're having fun and that's just good old-fashioned American uh money laundering uh slush fund uh you know Empire building stuff this is what we do um and uh you know I'm just uh you know it's it's unfortunate we're we're um we're enjoying this though and we're we're enjoying it a little too much it's a little scary how much we're liking it um it's it's Biden's you know he's allowing him to seem strapping and cool remember Boris Johnson in the UK did this when he went to visit with I'm sorry when he went to visit with zelinski if you were an embattled leader in your country you just visit zielinski and you walk around kiev for a few hours and it's a nice boost it's a boost to the numbers I think by the way people army hammers should do that why are celebrities not doing that why are celebrities why don't canceled celebrities visit Keith get Harvey Weinstein out of jail have him walk next to zielinski down a main street in Kiev Kiev whatever and I think you could be looking at a good boost in numbers Bill Cosby's on tour I've got his first tour date Keith this is how much we love the war how much we're enjoying it we have an article in the New Yorker can psychedelics heal ukrainians drama so we're basically like let's not end the trauma let's not end it micro dose mushrooms take some psychedelics get a shaman take some Ayahuasca it'll be like the war's not even happening you can therapeutically cleanse yourself of War we're not going to stop the actual War but you can feel better about the war with a nice psychedelic regimen meanwhile in New York Ukrainian delegation including a representative for the territorial Defense Forces had gathered to consider types of Aid other types of Aid the goal according to an ad for the event was to promote the psychological and spiritual resilience of Ukrainian people living in trauma crisis and War it's a psychological resilience we're promoting your it's tough we know it's tough we know it's tough and we know that we could maybe in a way kind of push for some type of peace talks but we're not going to do that we're not gonna stop this war in fact we're going to pour gasoline we are now pouring gasoline on this it's wrong that Putin invaded all war is terrible but the idea that we want this to stop is kind of hilarious and now we're basically telling ukrainians you better get Dr you better use drugs because we're not ending this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] so you better start using psychedelic drugs uh you know whatever it is here's great demetriev whoever this guy is kick things off by telling this group okay through a translator that he hopes to train 1500 Military chaplains in special spiritual resilience program so the new plan for the Ukraine war is to have the chaplains act as shamans and guide people through microdosing in Ayahuasca so they can feel better about this war um so they can work through their trial and I'm not saying psychedelics don't have um a place in in therapy of trauma here's what also is really good in terms of therapy and Trauma stopping the trauma stopping the trauma not spending billions of dollars to keep the trauma going that helps as well yes stitches can help wounds also not throwing a kid off a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] roof like there's there's other ways to calm this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] thing down but as the official sponsor of uh the Ukraine uh War we like we we like the idea that we are participating in a very confusing uh battle where there are no real clear objectives and very little identifiable National interest so we can just kind of rev this baby rev it up Let It Go 20 years a 20-year uh War here would be our best case scenario a 20-year war that bleeds Russia dry foreign now here's the other thing I want to get into because I I mean you know the Ukraine will check in on it every now and then it's the year anniversary congrats but we're not going to we we can't you know it can't be all Ukraine all the time even though we are the official sponsor of the Ukraine war and we'll continue to be and we will provide uh people in the Ukraine uh with whatever they need whether it be uh uh shroom tea or whatever helps them deal with the uh bombings that uh our money and support uh guarantees will not end also uh China is now stepping in so China our favorite country China my godson uh uh China's president Xi Jinping um he's going to Chinese leaders expected to use Moscow trip to push for multi-party peace talks so China is actually uh thank God someone's running the world China is now stepping up to uh do a peace treaty in the Ukraine China is stepping up to do it whereas America uh we are you know proceeding with the Ayahuasca uh Retreats um Beijing says it wants to play a more active role aimed at ending the conflict boo maybe they're not going to end it either I don't know I'm not going to take them at their word for it maybe nobody wants attend and the people familiar with aji's trip planned a set of meeting with Mr Putin would be a part of the push right nobody wants this war to end I have a bit about it on stage I don't really want it to end nobody wants it to end I'm sorry we can't have an end now we're in it it's just a good pillar of the news nobody wants it to end it's accomplishing a lot of things for a lot of people there's a lot of people with financial interest in this we can have it end we don't want any nukes because that's mean but what we want is just a prolonged conflict there this is not something anyone wants to stop I'm telling you nobody wants I don't think China wants to stop this either maybe they do maybe maybe now what are these people whining now about here's the deal with climate change we're all dealing with it in our own way it's been freezing in Los Angeles the winds are insane everybody's upset why are these people in Palestine Ohio getting all of the attention everybody's dealing with this every single group of people in America is dealing with this my friend who had a beautiful Waterfront in Florida it's like down to the studs now now of course you wanted to do a renovation anyway it kind of comes in handy and she has a place up in the Hudson Valley she can go the point is she's dealing with a horrible situation in Florida where she has to renovate her house um because it was just destroyed so these people in East Palestine Ohio uh that are complaining about this trained derailment constantly I don't understand why they're sucking up all the oxygen and that I'm not trying to do a pun um I don't get it I don't get what the big deal is a train crashed with some chemicals and now you have some headaches and you're itchy what's the big deal this puts you on the map EPA Chief Ohio governor drink tap water near train derailment site after heavy what's the they're drinking it what's the problem I'm sick of these people just because oh the sky is full of black smoke and oh I have a horrible headache I can't sleep I'm inching my kids are screaming there's no more shared sacrifice anymore okay 11 cars carrying toxic chemicals whatever derailed as a train passed through the town on the Ohio Pennsylvania border officials conducted a controlled burn of this build chemicals to prevent an explosion they're trying to help you um releasing large plumes of dangerous chemicals into the air that left foul smells in the area and has reportedly made livestock and pets sick um I think the people here are overreacting um I knew people a lot of people that went down to Ground Zero and uh breathed the air in at Ground Zero and some of them are alive so I just think that like I understand people being upset but you really you have to look at is this just do you just want attention is that really what it is is it like oh no one's ever talked about Palestine Ohio and this is the time for now people to just get a chance where can you are there like some type oh look at that that looks can we bring that up this looks not bad this is from what space this is not even a big deal this thing this is a small train derailment with 11 cars with a few toxic chemicals a control burn in the air that's uh giving people um headaches for days they can't sleep uh and their pets are dying but other than that I don't see a huge problem here and I think really this is just again a bunch of people in the middle of Ohio that want to go Hollywood this is the this is a culture of reality TV freaks who want attention do we have any of the uh people like are there any of the citizens of Ohio can we hear from them are they I mean can we at least like hear why um this is being dominating the news cycle constantly and I'm unable to understand why this is getting more pressed in an incredibly freezing cold winter in Los Angeles that is forcing me and several of my friends indoors when many of the houses are built for indoor outdoor living many of them are built literally for indoor outdoor living where you have a a pane of glass separating the inside and the outside I don't even understand and all I hear about is is this it's uh Palestine Ohio uh the train we're mad uh the people in Ohio are mad their pets have headaches it's like guys can we please you have to enjoy it stop being paranoid about everything it's just 11 cars of toxic chemicals you know I think that it's a bunch of people being babies it's a bunch of big babies just get out there throw a frisbee get out there and move get out there get your steps in you know these people aren't lying they're not gonna lie you think they would tell you that water was okay to drink if it wasn't do you believe the government would do that do you think they would tell you that the air was okay to breathe just so that you wouldn't it wouldn't be mass panic do you think they would lie to you just said they wouldn't be mass panic and then years later when many of you pop up with a weird illnesses that can't be traced to anything except the fact that you all lived in these Palestine Ohio during the train derailment uh do you think that is like realistic that sounds like a movie that doesn't sound like something that would actually happen like you know five years from now when people can't breathe and people just you know in the middle of the night start uh expiring uh yeah I mean that sounds like a movie I think that it is safe I think it's okay I don't think it's a big deal I think it's cool as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] actually the amount of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] photos and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cool [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] now happening in your community where nothing has ever happened no one's ever heard of this place and now it's cage getting all the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] attention the tick tocks coming out of there people getting noticed for the first goddamn time be a chemical spill influencer like use this to get yourself on track to making people know who you are if you're a reasonably good looking person in East Palestine Ohio get out there and start dancing in front of the smoke and I'm telling you this is your don't let this pass you by when Parkland happened those kids got famous Greta thundberg's been famous right you need to be if if there is a young climate activist this is your time right now your time to recognize you don't have to go to college uh or if you do it can get paid for you don't have to have a shitty job you can get out there and make this your brand I mean I'm telling you the media will eat it up they'll Eat You Alive um just do it you know people are complaining about uh headaches chest tightness eye pain this is a 28 year old told BuzzFeed news you know a lot I'd say it's anxiety you have anxiety this is what this town has they have anxiety this isn't real this isn't something that's happening to you just because of the uh toxic uh burn control burn of the chemicals this is at your anxious and you're nervous because you're getting your moment in the National spot like you don't you wonder if you measure up and you might not but that's really what it is like you are anxious and it's sad but I I don't think we have to go and and oh the worst cloth I've had shortness of breath and the worst cough I've ever had in my life drama queen will you stop what is this the long coveted crowd now because the train flipped over enough nearly one million pounds of vinyl chloride were on this train now the EPA has confirmed it's entered the Ohio River Basin which is home to 25 million what's wrong with vinyl chloride this is one of the deadliest environmental emergencies in decades and no one is talking about it vital chloride is not only flammable but it's also brain lung blood and liver carcinogen authorities decided to burn hundreds of thousands of gallons of this chemical after a trained derailment in East Palestine Ohio well what could have happened they said is if it would exploded it would have sent shrapnel for a mile one mile and you would have been like sitting in a chair and then it would have been like Final Destination so what they did was they decided to burn off the chemicals in like a controlled burn and then tell everyone that it's just chill you know and I think that that's the problem right now is people are not acting chill pretend that nothing's happening you're suffering from anxiety I don't think people are complaining about the smell too they're saying the smell is like a mix of super glue and bleach but it has a bit of sweetness focus on the sweetness glass half full focus on the sweetness that'd be worse it could be like the kids in Ohio I I was reading about these school lunches and apparently I don't understand this um during covid apparently people in Ohio were given a free lunch for the kids kids were able to eat food for free and now they are not the school lunch program in Ohio is ending uh and that means that people get a pay I think it's two or three dollars a day um uh for two dollars I mean it's two dollars a day per child okay but some parents are struggling and they don't have that um and so basically they're coming out and saying they're taking I'm not even kidding this is not even a joke they are taking the trays from the children who cannot pay they are taking the food back from the kids uh quote that was a little heartbreaking for my staff to deny children and take the tray away they are taking the tray away from children in Ohio and they are giving billions of dollars to the Ukraine for weapons so just process all that in your head um now I'm trying to think if there's any reason someone would be against a school lunch because I know that like a free school lunch because I know that that is kind of an issue that people debate and I know that it's kind of a contentious issue I could see you know my father said to me once a hungry dog runs the farthest and I'm so I'm thinking now is that potentially the thinking there like you know sometimes it's good to motivate a kid so when the kids come into the lunchroom and they all have their lunches and they're all eating and one kid uh or a few can't afford the lunch and they go to grab the tray and you take it from them and go no it's not yours and then they have to sit there their blood sugar drops and they kind of get listless and they're upset does that motivate them to like go home and learn about the stock market I don't know that is a good question like what is why can't we just make food for all of the kids you'd think that we could just have enough money to make a lunch that would feed all of the children but maybe there is a reason that some of the children shouldn't eat and that's something that I think we do have to explore number one kids are fat so maybe they're just denying the fat kids food which I think helps if they maybe if they just sat all the fat kids in it or maybe the fat kids uh made them like work out during lunch so when all the other kids are given food the fat kids maybe they're putting a a side of the uh you know uh cafeteria and they're made to um you know I don't know jump around but um I I don't I'm trying to think of what what would be a good reason to not pay for maybe the kids if the K will it teach them to not work hard if we keep giving them like a free two dollar lunch a day like if we give them ziti or we give them the hot dog does that just create complacency where they're unable to function I don't know what I also found is that children who come to school late they end up in panic mode worried to death they're not going to get their breakfast because they missed it and the doors closed a lot of people now don't eat breakfast at home um a lot of people wake up this is what happens and I don't know where in Ohio this is but this is oh this this is for all of Ohio the the thing that's being discussed is for all of Ohio um but a lot of times people wake up now and they see their mother is like drinking you know she's like drunk and she's in a house dress and she's wandering around and uh uh she's not like cooking eggs for them and their father's dead or missing and so it's a kid like that who like wakes up Mom's drunk already she's like laughing to herself at the table looking at old pictures and she's coming in and out of laughing and crying and then the kid is like hi Mom I love you and then gives her a kiss on the head and she's like look at you when you were a baby and she's crying and laughing and she's kind of rocking like sometimes they Rock back and forth at the table like this or maybe she's not saying anything maybe the kid wakes up and he walks downstairs into the kitchen and the mother's just kind of like rocking back and forth and then the father is maybe out uh tilling the land he's telling the land or maybe he's uh Dead uh or maybe he's I don't know you know doing something else so the kids now they don't have the breakfast right they're not able to it's not like people you know we grow up with those 1950s commercials where like a mom is making eggs or making pancakes but that's not true or like Mom sometimes is working now like sometimes kids wake up and the house is empty because the parents are at work right so then the kids aren't gonna go home I mean they're not gonna go downstairs and fend for themselves uh they need to go and get a breakfast at school but a lot of people are against that and and I I don't I mean there might be a good reason for it why a kid shouldn't have a breakfast in school maybe maybe they should figure it out I don't know I'm I'm I'm in the middle on this I'm undecided should children eat you know what I mean like this is a good question I don't think it's as easy it's I don't think it's as easy as people make it out to be people just go oh yeah we have the money feed them yeah but hold on a minute you know I don't know if that's a good idea I know that for example lunch eating lunch for me uh ruined a lot of opportunities for me because we would eat in mortgages we would eat such a big lunch that uh many of us would fall asleep in our chair or go into that state where you're kind of asleep uh because you've had so much uh carbohydrates or sugar you're kind of like checking in and out and maybe that's the problem here is that we need to have kids kind of being like on a fast and healthy but um I'm unsure I I welcome anybody that's had experience with this the pro-hungry children and people that are anti-hungry children I I appreciate like a debate either either way it's um we need stronger kids healthier kids and I don't know if that requires feeding them

really does too and everybody loves them so helixsleep.com Tim day you know these residents of these policy is it Palestine Palestinian Palestine Palestine Palestine Palestine Ohio the residents of Palestine Ohio in my estimation are being a little dramatic and they are being ungrateful uh for the government um because like I said the uh the the EPA people like that have came down to Palestine Ohio and they've drank uh uh a glass of water that they're claiming is from uh you know the water system it was probably Fiji but even still even performatively I think that's a nice thing to do I think it's a nice thing to do and there's just a lot of whining and now people are saying that uh you know it's the vinyl chloride and I'm having headaches and a lot of it to be honest with you it's bad diet a lot of these headaches are bad diet it's high sugar high carbs watch does Joe Rogan Experience uh you need to switch to a carnivore keto diet because a lot of these people in Palestine Ohio are you know high on sugar all day and these are the headaches because you're coming down off sugar and this is really bad so I think it's primarily diet related a lot of what they're experiencing I think it's maybe anxiety and I think it's maybe stress I don't think it has anything to do with all the vinyl chloride Burning Up the Sky I think that's such a jump it's such a jump to make like just because a train 11 train cars full of vinyl chloride exploded in your town that's the reason you're itching it's such a jump when we know Dairy is inflammatory it's hugely inflammatory people get rashes all the time with dairy when I was a kid I would get rashes with ketchup and I love ketchup and I eat it all the time and I shouldn't it's liquid sugar paste but it's so good but it gives you rashes you can get some people get rosacea from nightshades which is like eggplant tomatoes and such things of that nature so what you're seeing here I believe that Tim Dillon show believes you're seeing diet related illnesses in in East Palestinian Palestine Palestine Palos Verdes wherever it is I see diet related illnesses in Ohio being wrongfully attributed to the 11 train cars full of the vinyl chloride burning up the atmosphere um let's hear what some of these ungrateful dramatic truly horrible people have to say about the things they're supposedly experiencing all lies these are all lies so I thought I wasn't sure if I if I was really smelling what I was smelling and feeling the way I was feeling um and then less than five to ten minutes after I started smelling it my son woke up out of a dead sleep violently shaking throwing up totally disoriented begging for water um and he was not sick at all like he he just wasn't there was no no indications of a sickness before this and it was shortly just a few minutes after I started smelling it so at that point I took them there kids have nightmares I mean is this woman new kids have nightmares they wake up often violently shaking and projectile vomiting sort of like an exorcist scene because maybe they're having a nightmare about you know not winning the big game at the school and getting the girl this is what you know or it's the boogeyman's chasing them through the cornfield these are common nightmares that kids have and a lot of them react to this with violent shaking uh projectile vomiting bleeding from the eyes a lot of people have nightmares and they bleed from their eyes so this woman is trying to conflate these two unrelated things her son middle of the night doing an exorcist and the 11 cars of vinyl chloride burning up the sky and uh the rivers and the oceans and the lakes and the air and the dogs and the cats and the birds of the bees and everybody getting you know so really it's the conflation of two completely unrelated things the small chemical Armageddon and her son waking up in the middle of the night like Linda Blair let's let's see someone else because I Feel Like This Woman's a liar and I don't like liars let's see what else we have this looks like a fun crew however since I feel like the 9th of February February yeah um and were any of you all home when it happened as well or I actually was home I jumped out of bed unlike him we didn't think we were getting evacuate and we all stood back there and watched it I texted her and she's like I'm staying here no problem and then finally they knocked on her door and forced her out of bed well I don't know at the area we've had a lot of suicides with the rain the railroad tracks there's a lot so that's my first thought was who hit the train now like I wasn't thinking like chemical warfare here so that's my thought she's like dude it's exploding so yeah my uh my initial thought I was downtown I was walking and I thought it was weird the train I mean the trains stopped over the intersection from time to time I just hopped through them when I were at this corner on the Clark Street you could see the Flames up in there and I work at that building right down there yep so I thought my shop was on fire so I went running up there to check on the Kiln and check on everything back end of our building caught fire so I actually for some reason stood out there and watched it for about 20 minutes like probably for me to you do it right because like you said we didn't know what it was right and are you all back uh back working in there is the debt building damage oh yeah they as soon as the evacuation lifted they were back in work of course back to work I like it back to work this is good that's America you'll watch the explosion you get a nice little break it's a nice little break but then you're back to work you can't use this as some lazy excuse to not go to work just because you now have a permanent headache you have to get back to work work helps you and people don't realize this that is uh you know that that you know there's so much anti-work sentiment in America all the time now um like oh children shouldn't work it's child labor or elderly people shouldn't work there's no that's not dignified and they're they're old and we should care for them they shouldn't work and uh disabled people shouldn't work and people with stage four cancer shouldn't work there's always this cut like rigmarole like oh they shouldn't work it shouldn't work uh let's figure it out oh they shouldn't work oh she has a brain tumor in two months to live she shouldn't work it's like really work actually takes your mind off these things and it's actually nice so what's encouraging to me is that while the smoke is still in the air these people are back at their jobs because that's really the ticket to the train so to speak that leaves them out of this situation this woman is now what is she complaining about her father and her boyfriend Chris after being a vacuum a complainer came back home today in this town but she says she broke out in a rash almost instantly I undressed to get into the shower and I had a rash all over the side of my face on both sides and Oliver my chest take a look at these photos of her this morning after coming back on her property the rash all over her face neck and chest my boyfriend Chris also had a rash down his left side and I mean to this moment right now I have just a really low grade constant headache they live nearly a mile from the derailment well they shouldn't be seeing each other naked if they're unmarried that's a huge problem right now is a cohabitation outside of the bond of marriage I'll hear nothing of what they have to say my point about this whole thing is it's been it's been completely mismanaged uh by uh like you know all of the uh the the government really needs to go and tell these people and they are but the government needs to not only tell these people they're fine this is actually a good thing it's actually a positive thing so the government has really failed we're losing the propaganda War it's called Soft power meaning that it's not only you know about you know military uh Power in America it's about propaganda and it's about the war of ideas and it's about information we've heard all of this that's not only foreign policy it's domestic too the government needs to show all these people how lucky they are to live in a country where chemicals are so prevalent that occasionally they spill think of the loveliness of living in a land where you can get all the chemicals you walked there's so many chemicals that occasionally they topple over and no one's concerned about how much they've lost they're just complaining about their bleeding eyes and skin falling off their face what they should be focused on is how abundant this Vinyl chloride is how much of it how easily it is to synthesize how we can make more and more of it and and that's really the the answer here is like thank you God that I live in a country with all the chemicals I could ever want on a choo-choo train going through my backyard how lucky am I how many people live in places where they are literally they cannot get anything they can't get anything ever in America there is so much vinyl chloride that no matter when you need it what if and this seems like weird to say and I know people are going to ridicule me what if some of the people in this town needed Vinyl chloride and now it's free for them is that not something we should consider what if some of the people in this town were like honey I'm going out against monochloride I'll be back a little bit and then they're like oh my God the Lucky Charms truck has uh toppled over and we're knee-deep and marshmallows thank Christ because now it's so I I think there's many things to consider here now what is Trump saying about this is he uh what's he what's he up to he was there speaking about Palestine and to the nearby communities in Ohio and Pennsylvania we have told you loud and clear you are not forgotten you are not forgotten we stand with you we pray for you we'll stay with you and your fight to help answer mayor can you make the accountability accountability it'll all be out there no way clearly is that the mayor that's the mayor you want to hear a clip of him talking I need to hear a clip of him this man is amazing yeah he was saying I want to hear the mayor I want to hear the goddamn mayor who's wearing a purple shirt from DXL something I would buy this man is wearing similar fashion to me he's more welcome to come if he wants to come uh I was very frustrated last night if you're talking about the comments I made last night I was very frustrated and you know I stand by those comments but um yeah if he wants to come he's welcome I like this man I like that he's in a DXL shirt I like that he is out there defending his town we hope we wish the best for everybody in uh in Palestine Ohio of course we have fans there should we do a show there should we do a benefit show I'm not even kidding should we do a comedy show to benefit the residents of East Palestine stanstan Ohio from New York City because even though I don't fear the chemicals and I think everything's completely fine and I think these people are just complaining over nothing just some routine uh leprosy um I feel comfortable if we could do a benefit show for the residents of East Palestine Ohio from Maine the rocky coast of Maine or you know in the uh you know potentially in Irvine California but we should do I I literally I'm not kidding we should do a benefit show for these people I don't know where the what the money will be used for but I would like to do a benefit show maybe From Another Part of Ohio because I don't think they have a venue for it there I don't know or maybe they do should I go to East Palestine Ohio to do a benefit show because these people need stuff and you know here's what I think we could do with the money that we raised we could buy more of the vinyl chloride they lost if we borrow more of the chemical that they lost is it not a successful endeavor East Palestine Community Theater where we sell real tickets that's not going to be good I wanna I want a big big big [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] theater uh to benefit the people you do Dayton and he's Palestine Ohio I I think it's the right thing to do and I'd like to do it stay tuned for that by the way stay tuned for the benefit show are being announced in East Palestine uh Ohio I would like I genuinely want to do one and I want to see how I can do what I think that could actually be really great I'm telling you right now everybody's using expressvpn because all of these private

watching uh TV in Arizona local news and they were talking about tranq dope this is what everybody's on now all the kids because fentanyl is I guess fun for a little while until you realize there's harder [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out there there's actually harder stuff than fennel you know the horrors of the world are unfolding now so quickly um uh you know all of the nightmares right the the the chemical explosions and the economic inequality in Sam Smith you can't fentanyl won't do it you have to actually do something harder and the tranq dope is what will uh get you to where you need to go because the fentanyl high is not enough to escape the nightmare you need uh xylazine authorized for Animals it's this event drug is one ingredient that an increasingly toxic brew of illicit drugs this started with bath salts um you know where it was like the the things about bath salts were like like the the headlines were insane it was like a a woman ate a pit bulls oh there was one headline where a woman strangled a pit bull to death on bath salts or a man ate another man's face on bath salts like it was unbelievable like the behavior the behavior that people exhibited when they were on bath salts yeah I mean it's like the attacker Rudy Eugene was shot dead by police who pleaded with him to stop but only growls in response so this is like a zombie in Miami this is from bath salts uh he's eating another man's face the police are like stop it and he just went ah so that's you know nobody's exhibited that type of behavior the bath salts now we have uh tranctope and tranq is like this homemade Brew this concoction of drugs to really really get you to the point where you're kind of a zombie dealers May mix xylazine into fentanyl to save money federal law enforcement Authority said the drug known as trank among some users can be purchased at low prices from Chinese suppliers and offset uh an offset some of the opioid in the mix and offset some of the opioid in the mix is presence in the drug Supply is part of the arms race between criminals seeking to enhance their products and authorities trying to disrupt the market so basically people are like throw a little trank in there get a little trunk wet your beak wet your whistle and if you like it you can come back um so what this is doing to people is it's zombifying bodies so they're you're seeing severe wounds uh they appear when users in where users inject drugs and on other parts of the body they start as like blisters purple or white they're encircled by red rings it becomes like lesions um they look like burn victims some people have legs amputated I mean I mean it's really it's zombifying people's bodies um there's a 28 year old Nathan Clark long time opioid user despite the toll xylazine is exacting on his body Mr Clarkson he can't stop using it as part of his regular drug consumption not taking it would send him into brutal withdrawal the xylazine is tearing me apart he said I don't have skin on the top of my hands you can see my tendons you can see my bones so this is uh the new hot drug on the street tranq dope and people are taking it even though they no longer have skin on their hands they have tendon hands and there you can just see their tendons the way that you would do be like a health book you would just see skeletal hands and people are going I'm still they still got to do it because if not what does this do for animals like what kind of what is this this xylazine like it's it's it's utilized or it's authorized most often and utilized for animals for cats or dogs or something um they use it on horses oh they use it on all the good [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] gets used on horses all the stuff that you know can really take you there can get you there do we have a YouTube is there anyone on tranq dope that we can like look at is there any type of exhibit a we can point to and say if because we want to make sure that you guys know who's on track dope in your life right so um if your son or daughter is sitting at the table with you you want to make sure that you have all well number one if your son sits down or daughter and they don't have skin on the top of their hands this is a big um indicator that they're on track dope truly so if you're sitting there and they're like oh it's just a friend you know just hang up Mark you go hey show me your hands show me your hands why just show them to me you never trust anything I say show me your skinless hands do your hands have skin on them yeah they do I promise show them to me why don't you trust me that my hands have skin show me your hands and then they just take their skinless skin and then you go drag top so you have to make sure that your kids are not on track dope let's see what else you can look for you underneath so this is like getting bit by a brown recluse spider your skin becomes necrotic meaning that it dies the skin cells die and it gets hard you can knock on it like but that's a leg a leg drug in modern history any worse tonight we have the answer trank drug users turned into real life zombies right down to the rotten flesh we didn't want to believe it either but it is real and it is here all documented in this I love the news voice when they're delivering this they're like there's zombies running around America it seems like it's a bad movie but it's real and it's here the trunk dope is real and it's here threat of xylazine mixing with illicit drugs xylazine is an animal tranquilizer tranq is what you get when you mix it with fentanyl lab hits for xylazine are up 112 percent in the west deaths are rising two into the triple digits xylazine has been confirmed in overdose deaths in Snohomish and King counties at least 12 that we know of and those most familiar with the drug fear it will get much worse he didn't have a flesh eating disorder he didn't have an abscess and he doesn't know how his finger went missing and to me that is just by the way she also looks horrible I mean let's be very honest this woman looks horrific she looks like she's on track dope she's got Tourette's this is a social worker this woman appears to be on TR if you showed me that I would say two words tranq dope drank dope she's on track how do I trust her when she's on track how bad is it out there now that people just can't even smoke crack anymore that doesn't do it for them they're like crack won't even work anymore I need trank let's see what this the rest of this track head has to say I said it was just miraculously gone a narcotic nightmare one young lady was telling me about it and uh she was saying that she used it and then was out and didn't remember anything moving like a chameleon through an already Dangerous Drug Supply that scared her enough to want to go to detox as if fentanyl wasn't deadly enough suppliers are mixing your children will move like chameleon through your home looking for tracked up with their necrotic dead skin lesions giving you a clue that they're on the new hot street drug track they seem everyone seems to kind of know what tranq dope is Rochelle long is a mental health professional she's like listen I use track occasionally just this month I can do it responsible and Clinics to brace themselves for the full-on arrival of tranq tranq is short for tranquilizer in this case xylazine you're strong enough for big animals like horses when it's mixed with fentanyl it gives users a brand new kind of High they'll think they start dancing and they they seem kind of happy and they're just having fun sounds great to an immediate like zombie like trance staring through you as if like a horror film it starts out you're like it looks like what [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and then it's like I'm jambe yeah I mean listen I don't I'm not I don't really tell people what to do to have fun because like I think people need to figure that out on their on their own um with something like tranq I will say that the downsides of the drug potentially May outweigh some of the positives like the dancing and the Euphoria I do think that there is a chance that the downsides of tranq are going to potentially on the scales outweigh the good but I leave it up to you I leave it up to you out there if you want to use it if you are a user of tranq um and you want to come on the show like via like Zoom or something you know we're not you're not coming near the studio but if you are on track and there's a way to get you to just tell us what it's like I'm for that you know that seems to make sense thank you for listening everybody uh
