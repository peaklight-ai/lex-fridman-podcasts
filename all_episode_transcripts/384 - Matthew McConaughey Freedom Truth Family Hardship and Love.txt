sponsors in the description and now dear friends here's Matthew MCC let's start with love your parents had a Complicated Love Story divorced twice married three times what have you learned about love from your mom and dad in their love story that it's messy that it takes work that it's ugly that no matter how ugly or mess it is don't go to bed until you've come back together to either Embrace or admit that you truly love each other even if you hadn't solved what the hell you're bitching about that love will win in the end literally 3 to2 with my mom and dad yeah um and that even in the two divorces and in the two times where they couldn't live with each other they still loved each other they just couldn't live with each other at that time for whatever reason they needed and I don't know the details if they needed their space Freedom or what but they were never out of love with each other um and that as a parent if you just when we're not sure what to do and you people give you a thousand books and advice as a parent if your kid knows you love them you're in the the black that's the main thing it won't work without that um and it can work and will usually can work with that they just know that fact so it's not just love for each other it's the love for the bigger family that ultimately helps you persist through the ups and downs [Applause] well I mean I don't know how much particularly my mom and dad were staying together at times maybe when they didn't want to because they had children I don't actually think they considered that I I I I think they were much less conscientious than say I am today I think my mom and dad were more like they'll be fine we love them they'll be fine but we we we'll we'll cross that bridge when we get there right now they were let's work it out between you and I is what I think my mom and dad were saying to each other or or not they uh um they they wanted and needed a relationship that was a tidal wave Rocky right angles tsunamis and to this day in in my life with Camille and I which I don't I like a river has some swerves and some some streams and some Rapids but I'm not looking for tidal W my mom's like what was all this everything's so smooth stuff come on come on come on come on so she challenges like Vitality because that's what my mom needed to communicate I don't think my dad needed it as much of that uh the the the the the the the the hard angles uh um that their relationship to I don't think my dad needed as much as my mom but the clashes demonstrated the passion that underlies the love yes and that's I've I've I've always been asked you know when I talk about my parents love relationship I tell the stories that are actually sometimes quite violent MH and there's some good stories there they're beautiful I think they're beautiful yeah I think they're beautiful too but I've had people go wait a minute that was unhealthy you can't that and I was like no that's again back to the beginning Love's messy and that what I love about those stories is that's where the love was actually you it was tested and it it could have broke been over yeah and it never was again the love one kitchen floor blood's drawn knives are pulled ketchup ketchup's all over yeah but we make love on the kitchen Florida in I mean come on beautiful so as romantic as it gets right there whoa uh what's a memory from childhood that helped set you on the trajectory of becoming the man you are today standing on the corner with Mr Mayor the principle of St Philip School I was in kindergarten and I looked up and there was a cloud in the sky and I said Mr Mayor is that cloud as big as the world and he paused for a minute and he goes well yes it is Matthew now my seven-year-old mind I went okay I can see the outlines of it and that must mean it is so far away because if that's as big as the world I remember it took 15 hours just to drive from from Long View to Florida last year you know and and I can't even see that far so that cloud must be so far off that is not worth me even considering space dreams any of that I was like Army I'm looking down I'm going to put my head to the ground I'm going look right in front of me and deal with what's in front of me because dealing with dreams and what's out there and not on this Earth that gravity holds down not worth considering you never make it it's not even worth imagining it's poof it's fairy dust so I think I got learned a lot of self reliance from that I think I I got a work ethic from that I think I got a hey focus on what's right in front of you do the deed take care of what's in front of you one at a time and slowly Notch up your way and hopefully there's some Ascension to that and it wasn't until quite years later in some ways decades later that I started to go oh I can project I Can Dream why because literally the first time I got in a plane and then 30 seconds I was in a cloud I'm like whoa we must be going a trillion miles an hour because we're already in that cloud that was as big as the world that I saw the edge of and then I grew and learned enough to go well that's not true train planes don't go that fast oh what Mr Mayor said wasn't really true that cloud is not as big as the world and it's not near as far away as I thought but I'm glad he lied to me what do you think about that that tension of a way of living life between being a dreamer and a pragmatist yeah which is a better way honey holds the the reciprocity of the two of them I mean I can't be present unless I got plans I want to I want to have the big picture in mind but I got to go day to time I like to write the headline or have a I think we need to have a North star something to look forward to but we all know that if we're staring at it we're tripping on the way if we're just you know the old you read the Hallmark cards and take irk me you know dream it you can do it I think that's a half-ass horrible thing to tell somebody yeah you know cuz um and you talk and then on the other side you have things like you know people say hope means nothing well yes it does that's the dream you just don't stop there there's not a period after that word now what do we do practically and I think that constant tension when that tension's a dance it's when it's beautiful there not but to see those as contradictions I think is where we is falling short so I don't I want on their own if we Silo the two oh well if you Silo the two I guess the the pragmatics the one to go with because at least you'll get something done but if you only Silo the dream and don't do anything about it that's you're kind of living an illusion and kind of living in a virtual reality Yeah It's Tricky even the people you love can sometimes suffocate the dream can uh make you believe that it's not possible it feels like a lot of parents kind of want you to be safe want you to be stable want you to have a plan so that everything's going to be okay yeah and the dream feels like a threat to that yeah how much of that though I wonder is is proper initiation because if you throw in dreams out I call it conservative or liberal late let's learn to block and tackle let's learn that work ethic those things those pragmatics first learn the rules of the road the rules of the game the things that we can all kind of rely on this is how the world supposed to work now it doesn't always work that way you know you teach a teach a child to drive it's like yeah you stay in the lane you go to speed limit this all help but that doesn't guarantee that no one else is running the red light but we learn that later um there's an initiation I think that's proper with the dream I mean you you I think parents my parents very much that way the idea of going to chase an acting career or something was what it was it was that was a different vernacular that was like not in our I was taught to work away up a company ladder and 9 to5 do your job but the day I brought it up and said I want to go to film School and I thought my dad was going to go you want to do what boy he was like gave me some of the best advice ever and told me not to half asset and said go in between the lines what he heard from me was that made him so happy as a father I believe and makes any parent happy is when our child doesn't ask us permission to go chase a dream oh yeah when they're going I'm bringing it up to you with full respect yeah but I'm doing this with her without you that's when a parent goes yes I've done something right enough I made I helped my child be secure enough in the pragmatics to have a foundation enough where they have the courage to go I'm flying The Nest to take the leap you wrote after my dad died I had a dream that left me with a statement less impressed more involved yeah what do those words mean to you we got to be more than just happy to be here I'm big on gratitude but we got to be more than just thankful to be here dream it you can do it it's got to be more than just dream it you can do it that's impressed uh the dream is still other than and if I'm here and so impressed with talking to you today if I have a reverence to an extent I will not be able to be involved in this conversation I'll be too impressed I'll be anticipating oh what's that question he's gonna he's he's gonna ask oh I think I know he's going this oh I think I know what answer you might love to hear oh I I'm not involved in conversation I'm too impressed so I'm removed from the present um for me what that literally meant to me when that came to me in a dream and I carved it in I remember carved it in a tree it took couple hours I still want I still know where that tree is Santa Monica it was uh um my father had moved on he'd left this life all of a sudden it hit me oh I don't have the safety net my dad was above law and above religion to me he had me if I really if I really was in the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] if I really needed him I trusted that he had my back above law above anything all of a sudden he's gone I'm going okay it hit me how much I'd been pretending to be the young man I was trying to be and not actually putting my ass on the line and having enough courage to take risk and actually own up to the man that he was trying to that he was teaching me to be and I remember the world got flat that cloud that Mr Mar that I saw up there was not way up there it was it was fog in front of me now and let's go into it it was I kept I'd say I probably gained even more respect for people and things but I lost certain amount of reverence that was keeping me from feeling like I deserved or i' earned things or or looking out for myself or holding myself to task um and I remember all the things that I and I was just getting going to Hollywood the time so I was getting Fame was out there as one of those clouds you know with being an actor and all of a sudden celebrity and becoming famous the reverence I had I remember it just it lowered down to eye level and I was able to realize it and go that's not a that's not fairy dust and don't give it so much credit to make it fairy dust like oh I not me no I could never no look that in the eye with full respect but less reverence and at the same time equidistant almost equal sublimation I noticed where I had been condescending people and things and patronizing and sling things off as like less than me and not worthy of my time it raised up to eye level and so they were all flat in front of me and the world was flat and I was able to shoulders went back my heart rose up my chin lifted up I looked the world looked things in the eye I became probably less sentimental hopefully not to a level that I got callous but I know became less sentimental um I became more courageous because you know when you have someone pass in your life or maybe it's it's similar to a situation you're going on in your own life with your Homeland you you you sober up on these mendacities that we deal with every day and this this this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that we that we that we we owe we give too much credit to too much significance to and you're like what am I what am I doing why am I I'm not even going to let myself emotionally get brought down or over related by this situation because I'm this is it doesn't really matter in the big scheme and so we we we certain things that I found reverence for and and hesitated from in my life I was now engaging with because I was like oh it's live this live is live let's look at in the eye and and and go forward through it and deal with the consequences what do you make of death does that scare you I'm not looking forward to it but it does not scare me do you think about it do you visualize it I do I do and it's a beautiful visualization and a beautiful dream when I go as part of the food chain it's not a good visualization when I go is part of a random act of violence in a freaking driveby or something because the second the a the the accident it it it it breaks a story that I believe has already been written at least I don't have the capacity yet to to to put it into a a story a Divine story of the lives that we we live and so there's something ugly and gross about it and it happens all the all the time you know to to to people all the time I just feel like when it's part of the food chain when I go as part of the food chain I'm like Ah that's poetry part of the flow of nature you return to Nature yeah there's Grace and poetry in that do you miss your father think about him when I think about him I do now when do I think about him thought about him yesterday working through a script I'm working on right now working on scene work and I just had that quick little reaction of wanting to show him hey check the that's try and then I I don't get sad I go he would have loved he would have loved this whereas my mom wants to be on the stage my dad would have been on the front row he's more fun to show stuff to yeah and he would have and you know as as what he would we would have he knew he was a character he knew characters I've based parts of all kinds of characters played and the and the man that that I am on people that he introduced me to and who he was um he would have loved the creative process of working on a script or or talking about hey movie why I always say I love the movie Mud because it's the one that I I've visualized and seen my dad come to me so many times as a 12-year-old and put his arm around me and go hey little buddy you seen this movie called Mud God damn it it's a good one let's go watch it that now now my dad was never got to see me start a career in film but he was alive 5 days into the over he overlapped the first five days of me working on my first film days confused now that I think is There's Something Beautiful about that he didn't never ever come to the set we didn't talk about it but he was alive for me to start something that was more than um uh more than a fat that was something that would become something that I love to do and I do miss not him you know and then I go out of that do I I I I we talked about him two nights ago with our with our daughter I was I was rubbing my daughter's feet and my mom who's living with this 91 comes in goes oh look at you just like your pop and he's like what he goes oh because my dad loved to rub somebody's feet rub my mom's feet rubbed All of Me and my brother's girlfriend's feet when we would have a date yeah they would come over early because they knew they were going to get a foot rub from Jim mcconahay and then we'd come out me and my two older brothers on this has been on for decades we'd come out sh ready to go buttoned up and they looked at like we ain't going anywhere right now and so we told the story you know to my to my daughter and I was like oh yeah my dad's is hands I miss his hands his hands could heal so you carry him in you I hope so I I I hope so and and it's a uh a challenge for me and I I suppose it's like this for any son how much do we hang on to and how much do we let go and evolve and update the OS and and and and and and and try to make be better or different you know it's that there's certain things that I know that I fully believe in it's like when do we religious when do we Cast Away Our Father you know when do we say no I'm going after the dream I'm not asking your permission I I I I I question that from time to time for myself because I and it almost feels blasphemic if that's a word sometimes I feel like you can't what are you doing you can't check that and go like well no I'm not sure if I want to really and then I immediately kind of let myself off because I believe where he is he's going go budy go you're free man you're not I'm not not don't I'm not going to hold you back if you misread that or I didn't teach you that as well as maybe I wish I could have go you're free you're not going to lose trust that you're not going to lose it's in your DNA it's in your lineage young man still it's scary to not have a safety net losing your father is scary in that way you realize this world is just you and some deep fundamental way it's just you yeah you're alone yes but a I mean also not having that it's such a gift of Deliverance though as well because it's a I think it's an I mean it's an awesome feeling to know to know we're alone to know we don't have that to know you don't have to take two or take three that it's one take I mean the peripheral vision improves you know the the the the the the link and understanding with our past improves because I know for me I was not ever considerate of my past at all because that my dad had that if I needed it he was my well for that well he's gone you know like said he had the literally had they have our back well then when they longer have our back all of a sudden going like oh maybe I need to look back and start giving some credit to how I got here what I'm doing and where I'm heading it gave me the first time courage to even look over my shoulder because again I didn't have to cuz I don't have to look dad's got my back no dad's gone from this life he doesn't have your back okay so I mean I don't know me because it's inevitable I I very quickly go to all right in the in the pain the loss and yes even loneliness which is different from being alone and loss pretty immediately part and partial with the pain I felt it in the pain you saw the gift the the red light of losing your losing your father pretty immediately less impressed more involved like came like couple weeks after moving on is there a trick to that to see the gift in the pain that's a good question is is there a trick to it not that I know of I mean I don't I have to I I I I have to catch myself from trying to intellectualize my way into the reasoning and not skip over real feelings and discomfort I mean I I I did get that from my mom and I have to watch it that that so resilient that we just dust oursel off and get up and go you want to sit in the feeling you want to feel it you want to deeply feel the pain I want to I want to deeply feel it I want to look at the eye and deeply feel it but I don't want to wallow in it yeah um now I was raised where you skip the deeply feel and let's go and I've said it before but that will lead to having turn into a person who is a repeat offender of the same crimes because you you just get up and you don't you don't have a winter in your life you know what I mean you don't have there's no introspective time you don't look over your shoulder the in the into the past and so you just get up and you're like all right i' I've I've stepped in the same pile of whatever 100 times and I'm fine I'll do it 1001st doesn't hurt hell it's good luck well hang on a minute maybe we want to stop and go what can I learn from that but it it it I don't know of a trick I think I think that I think that I think if there's any trick I would say it's just how quickly can we admit the inevitable that's want to talk about in The Book of get Once once you know it's inevitable how do we get relative yeah not skip it not throw it to the side not deny it which I'd love to talk about that here sometimes too about the value of denial sometimes the value of denial yeah um but how quickly do we do we once something's inevitable go okay any mind and heart time I'm spending about going no I can't believe that happened no did that really happen anytime we spend it trying to deny that what has already happened that seems to me to be I'm not sure the value of that time so if any there's any trick I would say once you know something's inevitable even though how painful it is or how awesome it is start getting relative with that and in the relativity is seeing there's a gift here and if I realize that gift I'm honoring now I'm on to building up the beautiful passage of my father leaving this life now I'm on the march to go yes let's let the Legacy let this become omnipresent let him live through me let me become more him it's transformed yeah so what value is there then to uh denial any oh I think there's value to den if you really commit to it I I get this from my mother yeah so it's a very pragmatic uh value commit to the denial okay and and and and and and and and and my mom yeah does it to an extent that that that that I'm like Mom do you have any consideration or context of situations and she does this is the thing every time I go she's not a shallow woman but if it is not if it is something if it is something happens in her life that is keeping her from going where she wants to go or having a a joy in her life that she does she'll straight ass deny it happened didn't happen no it didn't mom we we're right here I I I heard you yeah what you said no I didn't you heard something else mom now does she get some Amnesty on that she's 91 hell yes she gets some Amnesty on that um but I've she's not yeah does she repeat offend yeah but it's it's misdemeanor you know what I mean I mean it's like we all it's part of that thing when you got a family men you're like yep that's just what they do Just go with it you know and and and it's and it's it's ingenious in a way it's a tool she does I think it is more of a trick with her but she wouldn't so ingrained her it's not a trick it just do it done and and and I and I another reason I bring this up it's outside of just my mother is I did this uh um uh road trip course in this Art of Living event a few weeks ago out of the hundreds of thousands of chats that came in and responses that came in afterward it seemed to me that about 80% of people's challenges and problems even in their life were something in the past that they were hung up on that they could not seem to get past and it was it was holding them from going where they wanted to in their future and so I thought that was revealing I would have thought I I would have thought that was I don't know going in 40% it was 80 it seemed to be 80% yeah and then I thought about okay if you're here in the live show and you want to get the course you're into some sort of therapy or education or development or self- help whatever okay and I have a lot of friends and I know a lot of people that are in weekly and daily therapy and then I know there's a lot of people that are on prescriptions drugs and while a therapy and the right prescription to the right person for the right uh diagnosis is is is necessary I I'm questioning is there value to going if you're not getting past this today this week this month this year almost of a decade goes by you're still hung up and you can't get rid of that thing and your memory where and you it's it's got you paralyzed and you're you're you're a victim of it is there and you're doing the therapy and you're doing the work and you're taking a prescription if that's what you're taking where does there is there a value and going if it's holding you back from going where you want to go maybe you should just deny the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] thing ever [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] happened Kick It In The Head kick it off the curb I'm done with you I'm sick of you I'm tired of hanging out with you I'm tired of that thing whatever it is hold me back from going where I want to go so if I if I can't wax the car you know and and and and and get past this thing just kick it that's so powerful so one thing to do like with the loss of your father is to try to transform it to discover the gift in it the gift in the pain but if you can't keep looking keep looking you can't find the gift and the pain just deny it ever happened you could call that a trick but I think it's more than a trick because let me say this my mom after my father died went on and found a second love of her life for seven 19 years they were together CJ car love you buddy he's moved on now did she check with us a little bit like is this okay she gave us a little lingering half a second look that we knew that maybe was what she was asking and we came to was like yes it's okay and you know who else is saying it's okay who's dancing up there for you Dad so was that her denying that the man she was divorced from twice and married two three times and had three children with had moved on no but she didn't say I'm not you know well what's the book on how long I'm supposed to say single before I can be interested in another you know there's not a book on these things how do you feel is loving is is is loving CJ mean you love Dad less no is finding a new life and a new dance partner in this life in CJ mean that Dad wasn't your dance partner the dad wasn't the love of your life no so I don't know I mean in there maybe you know maybe there's another word I think it's denial but it's not really denial because it's not like it didn't happen that's a earlier example I was giving my mom she will absolutely go that light's not on Mom the light's on WE that light's not on if I say it's not on sometimes you're just like that makes no sense you're just absolutely denying what just happened we even have it recorded and she'll go well the recording's line yeah I mean she is that's part of a coping deal with her but I mean what I think is more important or more valuable is to talk about this she didn't deny my dad dying I didn't but she sure as held turned the page and said I can still start a whole new category a new life a new love let my let my heart love and be love loved by someone living in this life today that I'm still living in and that will not trespass on my love for my husband your father Jim M and I think I I I mean we were just thought that beautiful yes Mom go talk about green light go now if we're hung up going can't have one or the can't have them both got to have one or the other now we start to make a contradiction of the two ideas again which D our contradictions get us in trouble all the time man that's life though the contradictions right but isn't life if if if we just admit the contradictions are so much don't they become a paradox we admit that that's part of it yeah if if if contradictions are inevitable they hinty they do become a paradox don't they then we're in the honey hole then we're singing and dancing and have leniency with oursel while still holding ours to task and it's it's I think it's holding on to no each contradiction oh here it is again so it's a one-off it lives on its own separate from the last one no it doesn't they're connected that's why they are a paradox and then that's I think that's a much I think that's where life really is in the paradox yes and the dance of it uh I think the metaphor of red yellow green lights is just so simple and so powerful you write about some green lights being engineered and some being mystical which I love the difference of that what's the difference of the engineered green lights and the mystical such a cool word mystical yeah well the engineered ones have reason and the mystical ones have rhyme yeah you know Life's a mystery going forward but it's a science looking back I've prepared I've had ideas and written headlines and had goals and an athlete gets in shape for an event you know I get in shape for a role I read I study I work I prepare and I go and I'm prepared and I behave and I do it and I look at I go yes that's what I wanted to do it's engineered green light it's it's it's it's a it's a it's a conscious delayed gratification it's that if I do it today that pragmatic head down believe there's no Cloud out there but then I trust that there is one out there if I do keep my head down and do it I'll get that that dream we can engineer those habits work ethic prep expertise education now the mystical ones though don't make any sense they're not supposed to make sense they only make sense after right when they happen you backlog mhm and you connect the dots with how they got there that that that that red light you ran into that made you 30 seconds later to get to the restaurant that as you walked in she walked out mhm and he went good morning and she went good morning and yeah two months later you're dating two years later you're married you after that got a family and now you're sitting here 40 years later going I love you look at what we've built and you go back and go what if I wouldn't hit that red light those 30 seconds you know made all the difference and so that this life is this way yeah and that's just rhyme I mean we can't really add that up yeah it's a science when you look back you you you see you know why it was that you were you were upset and ticked off that you had to pick up the kids' toys before you left and they were supposed to pick them up and therefore you were late for the thing that made you ran into and you and you ran into the person that was walking in the office that the guy that you need the interview that's the guy you were looking for the job you wanted and you caught him cuz you were in the elevator with him and that 90 seconds on that elevator what got you that job that led you led you doing what you want to do I mean the significance is there but we have to I think what we also got to watch is again in that balance what do we Chase because if we just chase the engineering we miss magic M if we just chase the mystical we find oursel caught up in trying to give meaning to the Lego set that was on the floor that the kids didn't pick up that and what color was it and and and why did I walk out that that door and see and almost step on the Legos but if IID gone out the other door I usually go out of I would have gone there I would have got there early and wouldn't have run into the guy the boss and the the so you can start to give too much meaning on that as well I think we can give significance in too many places and all of a sudden I think we've all been there where you're seeing art in every single thing man that can be paralyzing it's like it's hard to leave a room if everything's significant you know or if everything's a sign you know how much of success in life do you think is uh engineered and how much is Mystical like and how much does it differ from person to person because I for me personally maybe I enjoy it maybe I'm genetically built that way but I exist more in the mystical so I don't make plans I traveled last summer in Ukraine with no plan I just went there no plan I didn't know how I'm going to meet the president of the country I didn't know anybody and so there's no plan there's no clear thing you're just roaming around and that's how I've existed in life and it there's something about giving yourself over to the flow of nature that I just enjoy makes life so much fun it's awesome when you can do it did you engineer though I'm going to put myself in the place when you got on the plane to go to the destination that was an engineered Choice yes with the intent of and maybe I'll meet and I'll run into and I can work up a sit down with so the engineer Choice was putting your shoes on proverbially get you know I always say this the hardest part about going to the gym is putting your shoes on right so to getting on the plane that was an engineer thought with a goal in mind but I don't know how I'm going to do it the choice yeah but shoes on yeah but there's not a clear it's a fog what happens after the shoes go on yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah it's going to take that leap so I I I wonder how much uh for people who are successful in this world in finding what makes them uh truly happy and fulfilled how much of it as engineer how much of it is Mystical how much was it for you well I'll say this like when I went to write the book green lights which is basically the last 40 years of my life I thought that 85 90% of my successes were going to be obviously engineered where I could see the science saw the habits here's what I did yep that add up got the solution got the conclusion I was very surprised when I noticed it was probably less than 50% and that most of the real successes my life were when I trusted the Mystic then when I trusted that I didn't have to Define it that I only trusted that I didn't have to go what's the measurement what's the score what lead what this leads to what what's next um and I for me that that's still that's still a challenge for me daily now is to trust and not be because I can be I can I think I can be overly practical and I think I can over overcompensate and miss out on Magic because I'm still going wait but do you are we giving enough am I are are we giving enough the measureing credit to actuality are we am I giv enough credit to this is these are the steps to take and and and and and and this is reality I I I think I'm reminded when I when I trust because that go on with the Mystic just to put yourself on the plane was the engineer but getting there and as you say you seem you say you roll in that mystical it takes a lot of trust yeah trust in the inevitable Amen on that to but not knowing where it actually ends you it's a it's a feeling more than um uh I don't think it's a Clear Vision right it's kind of like a feeling that guides you towards a towards a place with with uh without a clear name without clear characteristics it just kind of pulls you there where do you get that courage and Trust to go with your gut your your feeling and is there for instance three days later you sit down is there if you didn't if that if that doesn't happen is there a sense a week two weeks later now when you come back to America they're like ah I failed sort of uh looking back to try to analyze what went right what went wrong that kind of thing uh yeah that engine is always there but I think what pulls me forward in life what makes me really grateful and fulfilled is noticing the thing you mentioned noticing the magic and kind of going towards it sort of just sitting back um both in tragedy and in Triumph so in war there's a lot of tragedy but there's somehow uh one of the things you see in in war this is the first war I've experienced and seen seen the front is the loss the people lose their homes and all this kind of stuff the thing that rises from that is the love for each other so they uh the people I've spoken with don't give a damn about the home don't give a damn about the on farms on animals they lost don't don't give a damn about um having to move and all this kind of stuff as long as the family is still there as long as the people they love are still there and it's like that's the the there's a Melancholy smile they have on their face like yeah this world is full of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it's full of tragedy but life is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] awesome and that and you just notice that in in in little ways everywhere you just sit back and yeah notice the magic and I I want more of that and just kind of follow along like a little ant yeah keep noticing that kind of thing but uh I don't know I I hope you know what I what I think it is is other people notice that you're the kind of person that notices it and they're like I want to hang out with that person he seems all right like he seems one of the uh one of the good ones one of the good ants do you do do do you have uh um any certain non-negotiable structure before that freedom to go with the feeling I think so there's a set of principles of just uh basically integrity of being uh good to other people like whatever that means for me there's specific things like I I'm really into loyalty Above the Law right there's a kind of like there's a circle of friends I have and that means everything um there's just a basic deep kindness to towards others um empathy empathy towards people that other that others might label as um even evil I have that kind of empathy I believe all of us have the capacity to do good and evil and so I just kind of see everybody as little babies that grew up in different conditions and so some do evil some do good and there's yeah there's there's all kinds of other uh principles I love the dynamic between the different humans in their full diversity I love the the dynamic between the masculine and The Feminine and enjoy it the dance of it yeah yeah so you you have a constitution with which you Embark you do too chasing yes I I hope so um and if yeah for me I'd like to it's inspiring to hear someone like yourself go I go and I just land and I just go I'm gonna feel it um I can go back and go yeah my greatest truths I've crossed my greatest successes in my life or when I just trusted that and go I took a one-way ticket Amazon Africa yeah and those were spiritual and very pragmatic because they led to dealing with with with succeeding in other in other ways that are more pragmatic 100% and gave much more meaning to those things but that's that's to be able to go out and and say that's how you do you have family I really want to get married and have kids but I I'm not married and don't have kids yet okay so actually one of the nice things about that is you can take bigger risks yes so while I'm not married and don't have kids I feel I owe it to myself to take just to go go to the Amazon I don't throw that backpack on in oneway ticket yeah that does get harder to do um I miss that um some sometimes the the whim the song that comes on you know yeah where's that guy from oh they're from the place that I want to go that I had a dream I'll go there one way ticket what do I got to do I'll get a couple shot okay go that that there that that that was that was fun do that just get up and go you're free to and go when are you back when I when I get there yeah it's a beautiful beautiful thing maybe never yeah you don't know my yeah Cas you'll be coming to visit me in this new place maybe yeah how did the Amazon how did the trip there change you what do you remember of it such a magical place I've stripped a lot of my past symbols and talismans while I was while I was there what I what I I remember getting there and and and and just having so much adrenaline on the anticipation anticipation of getting to theend Amazon in the first 10 days I wasn't really enjoying the trip I was just charging to get to the destination to get to the banks of the river that I had a dream about and then it just humbled me I got so fatigued on night whatever 12 and was so sick and tired of the internal dialogue I was having with myself was not enjoying my company that you know I I I I purged and I remember and and and and and stripped off identity markers that I'd sort of been hanging on to for like everything from you know what it means to be an American my Dad's ring m from mccon a meltdown of my mom and dad's class rings from University of Kentucky were gold from her teeth and and and and and and his class ring melted down you know put taking that off was really hard to go I'm casting Am I Casting out my father I wasn't casting him out I was just removing to say I don't have to rely on that being all of my identity so to pull that off to to to strip down and to where I was just a a mammal that next morning I I was light I got present I remember WR writing something down I like all that I want is what I can see and what I can see is in front of me that sense of not I wasn't leaning around looking around every corner to get there and as soon as that hit me talking about mystical successes and realities and truths as soon as that hit hit me and for the first time in 12 days I didn't care about getting there or what was around the corner guess what was around the next Dam Corner the Amazon I mean not around a few Corners the next corner there it was and that was just like a touche you know those times when the prime mover the universe God what we want to name or believe in says ding there you go and that form of Detachment from holding on for dear life to things imp past so hard that you're not letting the beauty that's right in front of you to to feel correctly and follow our intuitions to have those not cast them out I didn't burn them I didn't get rid of those things just took them off and had to recognize you're still here you are you you're much more that is a Talisman that's a symbol that means something to you and that's good don't cast out the meaning but it's not like when the Ring's off and the hats off and the crucifixes off your neck that you're like you're GNA die and no those are reminders hang on to what they mean for you as we go forward but as we go forward quit worrying about so much about you again I was looking at the proverbial dream the cloud so much that I was tripping over myself to get there and like clockwork Just Amazing Grace boom as soon as it hit me and I was like Ah that's it all I want is what I can see and all I can see is in front of me literally looking down at the ground at what was a SE 10,000 Wild neon blue Amazonian butterflies on the ground soon as they fluttered up my head came up with them took a few more steps and there's the Amazon that's what you came over here for oh howdy those kind of that that truth like that well the Amazon's interesting too because it really has no past or future losing the moment cuz how fast it turns it just eats up life it like if a thing dies it just gets swallowed up CU um maybe because of the humidity because of all that because there's so many living creatures that kind of eat each other live on each other so it really exists in the moment and all this kind of diversity of Life there it's such an interesting place talk about food chain yeah you're just part of it there yeah we we humans somehow Escape that food chain but we're still the roots are still there are we I think we're a bit arrogant to think we've escaped you think I'm be a romantic in that in that in that notion well sometimes when you're in a big city when you're in Austin Texas and La you can think like oh there's we're in a car we're in a house we're safe but yeah somehow some somehow is nature still a part of us our roots are still a part of us I think it is more than we realize more than we give it credit for I I actually have a i believe that we are that it's a really arrogant notion to think that we are separate meaning you know people talk about pollution on a larger scale the climate what have you I think earth going to be just fine yeah we maybe not be here for it but I think we have a bit of arrogance sometimes to think that we can Trump Mother Nature I think we have more more of the natural law in us um and I sure hope so if I'm wrong well there interesting I've recently been uh there's a guy named Max techark at MIT who really worries about nuclear war and he was part of uh constructing a simulation of what happens when a nuclear war happens it's interesting to see that uh you know some very large percentage of humans on Earth uh starve to death because they don't die first from the explosion they die from starvation because uh basically um dust covers the entire North America and entirety of Europe and uh so the crops all die all the food sources all die and people suffocate and um starve to death but you know the lesson you learn from that over a period of a few months even though most of the human population of Earth dies Earth finds a way life finds a way to adapt yeah to adapt and it's going to be just fine yeah in terms of the big um living ecosystem that is life on Earth MH and yeah it's humbling to think about well maybe we're just the stepping stone uh same thing with talked offline about artificial intelligence maybe humans are just a stepping stone to the development of these other super intelligent entities yeah yeah and is it unconsciously in our nature that that's just part of the evolution and adaptation of our species and we because we're going to we were talking about earli what AI becomes is competely 100% based on Who We Are and we get to see it for some time a mirror to ourselves okay this is what human civilization is like these uh AI systems large language models are trained on human communication and you get to ask it questions and you get to have conversations with it you get to realize wow this is what the uh the collective intelligence of the human species our Collective wisdom and knowledge that's what it looks like all the bias the hate uh the paradoxes all that is in there yeah um the contradictions you can even convince those models you can you can tell them they're lying and they're going to start changing their mind it's interesting to play with them yeah um it's also interesting to consider that maybe they uh they become smarter than us and uh become almost life forms that live among us and maybe one day kind of we merge with them there's all kinds of possible trajectories that we take here how much of that excites you how much of it scares you is it possible to exist in a place where it's both exciting and scary but to exist in that dance mostly I'm really excited because I see human beings as deeply lonely like there's a deep loneliness in all of us that's how we seek connection uh that's why we seek Connection in others that's why love is so beautiful when we find other people were connected with and I just think AI can add to that it can add friends that you can have great conversations with and then some of those friends would be AI systems they'll call you out in your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in the most fascinating and interesting of ways and challenge you and help you uh explore ideas together so I'm excited by that is that different and if so how from the internet and Facebooks and these groups and communities that were I think it's fair to say set out to say this all access of information and people will help us find more common denominators than divisive ones um is is it you see it similar yeah it's similar but further into that direction I think the internet has done an amazing thing in connecting us and expanding our minds and helping us find community that feels like our community and then communities that are totally different and you learn from them I mean Wikipedia alone one of my favorite websites just opens your mind to all kinds of cool stuff yeah it does and not the do system anymore no and so uh I think AI just makes that even easier cuz Wikipedia have to like read and have to do a lot of work uh with an AI system like a large language model you can just shoot the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it's more like drinking a beer uhuh versus like uh doing homework yeah yeah yeah yeah it's already happening what do you think about that becoming the new family to where you know you said you're not married you don't have kids could you see a future for yourself where do you have a relationship with AI and that is your family and that's the main that's the primary like even romantic relationship yeah I can see it that one worries me I like to keep it at friends right I think I'm not ready to commit to the Romantic um it it's I wonder how much that now that takes us back to the Amazon and nature how much we still need the human touch yeah and whatever magic there is between two humans which takes the leap into the Romantic versus just the intimacy of a good friendship I don't know so correct me if I'm wrong you you see AI as having a deep and meaningful friendship yes and hopefully it will be a friend that will help you evolve and be able to love even more and be loved and you can take that into to humanity and find another Homo Sapien yes to go yes and thank you AI my great friend for opening me up to this beauty that I have in myself and I can see in you my fellow human and let's come together and biologically create family if we want to and let's all remain friends with my friend and make your own friends with my friend's friends on AI and let's have these great neighbor it's a good friend that great friend that's a neighbor yeah okay mentor and friend just like uh now there's AI systems that play chess far far far better than humans and we humans still play chess with each other or they they chess is still a game that's fun for us humans right and then we use the AI systems to get better at chess to learn to train to discover new ideas but ultimately return to the chess board between two humans MH uh but of course this world is full of dangerous people and so those same AI systems can be used to um to harm to create false narratives to uh do social engineering and manipulate the masses in terms of what they believe and all that kind of stuff that's scary yeah well and I and I I get it when we and I have my my own fear and distrust is of of AI is based on my own fear and distrust of myself and others it there there's something it's so simple but I think it's it's it's a really fun sort of way to just set up this reality and know want it's kind of a duh but still needs to be said that AI is a prompt it doesn't do anything unless we ask it so what questions yeah are we going to ask is a question is what we need to ask ourselves because we're going to be looking in the mirror at our digital God that we create from ourselves and just to know that that's that place where it's awesome and scary exciting and scary we go oh it's it's it's our creation which is awesome at the same time oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] but it's it's prompted by our question s and gives us patterns from that which we give it but that prompting that's uh that's the art of life like we prompt each other in conversation our loved ones when you when you when you go out about your day today the next words you say the next word you say to me the question I ask of you that's prompting yeah and it can change everything I can say so many things right now that will completely just the the the the set of possibilities where both of our Lives can take given on the selection of words I use and you use it is crazy makes conversation pun yay and then same thing with AI except the nice thing about AI is it's tireless tireless right let me ask you this if you can falsely condemn me right now and I prove you falsely condemn me I can forgive you and we can March forward stronger than before yes in ai's tirelessness and retention can it forgive I mean Can it can it can it go oh oh okay yep sorry about that one that was wrong can it amend yes yeah you could prompt it to ask for forgiveness and it'll forgive you well like when I toggled around with it and you ask what should I be afraid of with you or is it's the Doom story it answer was always well it's up to you which it was awesome right there you go again it's up to us and it brought up you know make me synonymous with your human values and ethics and responsibilities and but it doesn't deal that I didn't find anyway deal with defining or making choices on its own of what those are yeah I think uh some of that is manually uh those are constraints put on by it by the creators of those large language models basically not letting the systems have an identity of their own and some of it is just not engineered in yet but I believe that we'll have uh systems that have an identity have a belief have a set of opinions that that carry through time and will we go to them like certain states where we agree with the law and disagree with the law or nations and I'm a member of this AI oh well you're from this AI tribe y'all believe this MH yeah there'll be an anarchist set of AIS there'll be the Communists there will be the uh the Nazis there will be the Democrats and the Republicans there will be the people who are on the keto diet and the people that are on the this other kind of diet this other kind of Lifestyle just like we have now there's little groups and there'll be AI systems they're going to be supercharged yeah they'll they'll be either the leaders or the foundation on which we build those groups and they'll be it'll be uh the possibility of all the fun we can have is endless of course the dangers always rise up there because I mentioned the Nazis I mentioned the all the dangerous ideas cu the the set of ideas that humans have come up with a lot of them are awesome most of them are awesome I would say but some of them are dangerous the reason they're dangerous is because they become viral there's something exciting in us about those ideas but they also harm others a lot cuz that's who we are as humans we're uh we're capable of and all the dark stuff of hate and all this capable yes we also choose it do you think most people are good yes but I also believe we we got we got the good in the evil in all of us and it's which one which which wolf we feeding you ask people to draw distinction to describe where are you acting and where are you being uh what's the difference What's um what's the difference between being fake I me use that word and being real okay yeah and the word authentic gets thrown around a lot and you know and and I don't mean I used to think I used to be feel this way but but Bob Dylan loosed me up on this idea a little bit you think was all about get to be the your only one and only true self yeah that's it everything else is fake and then you hear Bob go well I mean we are what we create ourselves to be we are our own Creations which I'm like ah yes yes we are thank you Bob Bobby what I'm all for bullshitters and bullshitting I'm not as big a fan of the liars and lying what's the distinction you talking about the art form or bullsh liar a liar's fake a liar's faking it but not admitting to themselves that yeah oh yeah it's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] creation I'm faking it yeah of a liar I'm to your face right now and I don't give you that hair of a wink out of my right eye that let you know hey go with me here yeah yeah I think there's value in the bullshitting yeah now the lying becomes Troublesome because one I've duped you and I didn't let you know come on I was telling the story about catching the fish the fish always gets bigger every year we tell the story come on go with it all right yeah but the lying all of a sudden I don't know my own I don't know when I'm emanating something and creating something telling the truth being authentic or lying and I'm [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] all of a sudden I'm leaving crumbs with myself that Constitution gets blurry lying to yourself and to others yeah well you start to lie you lie to others enough you start to lie to yourself and you don't even know it and that I believe is dangerous territory that's why I'm trying to push this admit because that goes I'm not I I'm I'm trying to come in at a kindergarten level because we immediately jump to well I'm going judge that boom that's bad that's wrong no no no no no hold back on that let's let's go back to Bas love over let's just admit that we all [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] do it Lies We Tell others Lies We Tell ourselves Lies We Believe for convenient sake I do it I'm guilty of it I try to catch myself on it if I can just call it and go you know you're believing that lie out of convenience I'm like I know and I then I have to whe I'm saying that in the mirror or writing it down or sharing with a friend you know and I go okay well now I've inherently become a bullshitter then because I admitted it that I can shake hands with that's the little slight wink to ourself and someone else go come on it's a better story This Way in the course road trip you start with step one admit how do you do that how do you how do you kind of step back and do that in inventory yeah is there a trick to that oh if there's a trick to it I think it's just about courage of having the cuz it's I don't think any of us like to admit our lies or look deep enough in go I've relied so much on that lie that it's become my reality yeah and and I and I I don't want to be so puritanical as to say again that's why I say admit instead of judge but I don't want to be so puritanical as to go and admit it and get rid of it no I'm just saying admit it just bring it to the surface yeah I'm saying this and I'm doing something different I preached this but I actually my actions are just admit it just just admit the just admit them and I think that's the first step to where we begin to either forgive oursel and give ourselves some amnesty and go yeah I'm a human trying to make it through life as best I can I'm gonna let myself slide on that one okay and maybe I've been getting away with it for so long whole family my whole network works well on it okay forget this get to the base of the truth of the matter let me but just admit it and then where and then it will also help it'll be easier to then expose to ourselves which ones we go no I'm not let myself slide on that one anymore that is actually a lie I've been believing that's been keeping me from getting more of what I want in life that's actually a lie I've been living that I haven't admitted that is not allowing me to enjoy life as much as I damn well should be deserve to be or I've earned to be or just s of let myself sh man I had on on so it's not all the hard stuff sometimes it can be a fun thing I'm talk about how many times we major in our minors let's admit where we sit there and we go all right I give myself 12-hour workday but I noticed I'm spending eight on my hobbies and four on my career while I'm majoring in my minors let me admit that there's the math why don't we invert that I about four hours on my hobbies and eight on my career first off just admitting it allows me to go well now I can do the math or rearrange the math my time of day but I I look I just found a hobby tennis first hobby I've had in 25 years I had to admit that I that I went to play tennis for started to love it for the first month I start feeling guilty I was like I'm have is it okay to have this much fun I'm having so much fun and I'm getting a great workout I ADM I was like yes it's okay congratulations but he found something that is you're finding quite pleasurable for straight pleasure you don't have to forget all this other stuff about yeah but I'm also getting a workout yeah you're getting that too but don't just you don't have to excuse the pleasure be based on oh but it's it's good for you and you're no you damn it the real reason you love it it's cuz you you're having so much damn fun at it I had to admit that to let myself go damn R I'm going to play tennis again today or tomorrow it was it was a simple fun thing so it's not always about the hardcore stuff that we have to go this is a deep dark lie that I'm been living by and it's having me live falsy and it's having harmful consequences on my loved ones so some of those will probably arise when we admit I's just having looking around and just saying and when we admit it then we go when we admit a lie then we become something much more valuable a bullshitter yeah you had the little wink in your eye I love the distinction I'm bullshitting myself on that thing yep I'm lying therefore if I call it a l ad L yep well now yep I'm bullshitting y now just's out didn't judge it but now I'm bullshitting that I think we can work with well you're an interesting case study because you're one of the most famous one of the most uh charismatic successful humans in the world there's a lot millions of people love you hang on every one of your words that's a hard place to be how do you call yourself how do you admit that you've been living a lie how do you admit yourself in big ways and small ways on lies at this point given how many people love you how famous you are 10 years ago I don't know I I don't know was someone was talking about like yeah they really admire this so and so person because they're not someone who looks in the mirror and I was like yeah all I was like man I I catch myself looking in the mirror a lot and then I go in and I you know look at my my wife's side of her bathroom how many different creams and stuff she has out there I look at my side I got a lot more on my side I'm like I notice how if I'm out and public working out maybe doing pushups and maybe I do a few more if there's a group of people walking by that maybe I'd like to impress then I Mayan I do a few more than I do if I was on my own I'm like you are vain MCC yeah and the kneejerk is oh vanity bad B and all a I was like all of a sudden I became a bullshitter once I admitted and B I was like well Bravo vanity yeah let's go vanity let's instead of putting it in the cupboard in the LI section A vain because that's a that's a debit no admit it and then go what's the value in it well I look at yeah actually got in better shape because of my vanity actually I eat better look better and I have more energy you know and that led to being a better better husband better dad doing something with my kids when I'd rather be over there writing this work I'm working on but I know that tomorrow they when they leave town they're gonna remember this time that we had together that's a selfish act to go spend that time with my kids or my even though I'd rather not be doing it at that time I'd rather be doing something for myself because when they leave tomorrow they've got they'll have this great memory that they spent with their dad right before they went that that that I could call that vanity I could group that and say that's very vain of you that was for self yeah cuz it was also for something and someone that cared about are there people in your life that uh call you all in your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in the bad sense of the word [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yeah yeah sometimes it's either I got a pretty thick threshold for how far I can go with my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like what bruis what tickles me might bruise others to watch it that's a good line yeah um tickles me I bruise others but I also I go back and talk about the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that's over there with those mystical successes it's the yeah no no go with it don't pull a parachute yet let's see how far we can go let's see how hot I can get let's try it one more time yes two more please yeah that's where a lot of great pleasure and stories and successes will come from those are mystical they don't add up it's like we're not talking about reason right now we're not talking logic just go with this let's talk about the virtual and making it real the old line of fake it till you make it I mean there what is that there's something to that there's definitely something to it but I would you know where people would go fake it as I would go back to Dylan create it yeah recreate it create and recreate it you know until you till it becomes till you make it um so I'll have people call them on [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and a lot of times they're right I think when I handle it the most healthy way is I admit yes and I'm aware so and I'm going to keep going so you're not like resisting it denying it putting oh I will I will and I have to watch that where I'm like no I'm not that's not what I'm doing and and and use when it's coming from people that I care they're going no you are it's like I won't admit it and then that's where I'm telling a lie and that'll come up get be later and I'll go I didn't see it I didn't see I was doing that I was either unaware wouldn't let myself be aware I was denying that I was doing that would you say that's ego has ego been bad or good for you gosh I think it's been thank I'm so thankful for ego um do does it get off the bridal for me sometimes and run loose and run places and where it's not of service to others and has it hurt loved ones and even strangers yes um but I I I also when my ego is really strong it's it's in sync with serving it's in sync with where I serve myself also serves others serves others it's those two are part and parcel they're they're they're they're intertwine and that's the capital E ego that I think I think could hope we all need more of and that's what I mean when I talk about selfish that's the re redefining that the real true meaning of that is not doing something for self at expense of your neighbor or harming others it's for personal profit and pleasure that also is profit and pleasure for an utilitarian sense more of others and there's a there's again back to the Paradox I think there's a place I know there's a place I believe there's a place where those are in sync and when my ego's healthy um I'm able to say I'm sorry sooner for a lie or a misdemeanor or harm somebody I'm able to be more empathetic because I got the confidence yeah to be so I'm able to be more humble but still have my chin High m and my heart Heart High and look in the eye and go yep my bad bogey guilty I shank that one out of bound man that's beautifully put so ego can be constructive not destructive you wanton an Oscar for your performance in Dallas buers Club can you tell the story of becoming that character Ron Woodruff what was the toughest part the toughest part which was the most enlightening part was getting to know who he was in between the lines we're based on a life story in an hour and a half of film and the script is great but who was he in between the lines who was he before he started a business before he was on a crusade before you went to alternative medicines and you know the the the the obvious thing people always talk about well how' you lose all that weight that was not hard that was just a militaristic decision this is what I can eat each day and if I do this each day for a week I'll lose 2.5 pounds in a week so I'm going to give myself five months to do that 2.5 times as 10 there's go there's 47 lbs that was like clockwork so that was easy that decision was made I didn't go to the Pizza Hut buffet and have Temptation in front of me I had certain meals I ate that and when the and the weight just went off like clockwork it was the who is Ron woodriff in between the lines and what the the gift I got given that gave me the insight to who that man was was his I went to see his family and his uh before I was as I was leaving his family offered me his diary and I remember it kind of hes going wow yes but I kind of hesitated because it felt maybe a little too intimate of a thing for me to have it felt like it was kind of maybe infringing a bit but I opened my hand and took it and what I got in the diary was I got to know who Ron was before he had HIV and little thing the diary he'd write in and the the the the dreamer he was and then the getting all set on a Sunday night and laying his shirt out and ironing in it for the next morning making sure that his little pager had fresh batteries in it because tomorrow morning he was going across town to hook up some speakers for 38 bucks or whatever and then getting up that morning and writing about what kind of coffee he drank and how much gas it was going to take to get over across down to do that job and hook up those beers and then on the way over Paige coming in to say no we don't need you we've gone with somebody else to hook him up and here he was all buttoned up two cups of coffee in hair slicked over shirt ironed little less than half a tank of gas but enough to get back home now where's this Monday Go the whole open the disappointment you have to take all that in that's part of that man I'm going to I'm just going to go to Sonic and get double cheese bacon burger cuz Sheila over there man she's kind of cute she always gives me half price on it yeah which leads to Rolling The Joint hanging off till Sheila gets off to work sneaking over to the local motel and shagging up in room 16 that's my lucky number 16 Sheila then wandering out that night getting home at 1: in the morning no plans for Tuesday and maybe later in the week think about what am I going to do about work or job and these little dreams would be Peak and want to and then something would happen where he wouldn't follow through or the deal would go down the deal would go south that no one who that that there's in there was where I saw who he was a dreamer and and and and he just couldn't catch the break and didn't follow through and then I remembered his family said like oh yeah he invented he got patents on a whole bunch of things but he never would he had things to get patented but never would follow through to get the government patented and then later on you'd see the product be made or sold on QVC or something they'd be like Ron that was yours are they stole your idea did you Pat that he'd be like no like never would that that there's something beautiful and sad about that yeah that let me inside who he was in his heart and um and who he wanted to be and what he was hoping to be and trying to be but couldn't quite pull on when you go that deep does does the part of him stay in you forever are you able to let go I I mean I hope so I get I look there's a tenacity to to to survive that I got from him look hopefully I can try and find some of that in different ways in any character that I go play because that's if you if you if you really want to give a character an obstacle to overcome a need I mean the base one is life and death whether that's the need to survive or the need to Stave off Extinction I'm not talking about what the rule rules the laws are the social mores the manners and Graces I'm fight you you going to fight for your own life in a world that's not supporting you to do so you there's a wonderful courage of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it watch this what do I got to lose my life or I'm in charge of extending it get out of the way and I'll pick your pocket along the whatever it takes so there's a tenacity to live by whatever means necessary to survive that I that I that I'm reminded of that I learn from wrong so on that line of survival between life and death you starred in uh True Detective which I think um explores some darker aspects of human nature what did you take from that from that role from that experience philosophically psychologically the freedom of of of being on an island he was such a singular character and have a singular mind and as you know it wasn't a a dance party up there in his mind it was it was some some heavy stuff but but also existentially for him always like death would be a Deliverance for him and also be a cop out in a way it' also be he was not not a man who was going to give himself amnesty and didn't allow it from the rest of the world wouldn't give himself an out and while living in his head and heart and spirit was more of a hell than arguably dying it was not no alternative that's not negotiable for that man and that's why he was such a that's why he was the best detective That Ever Walked the Earth that's why he was such a superhero in a way to have that singular you don't go oh I wish I was him no but you like wow that Constitution that Clarity of identity talk about a measure in a in a man's Constitution he didn't allow anybody off the hook especially himself you wanted him to forgive a little bit or give himself a little amnesty you wanted him to like man it's Saturday bro can you go on a date he wanted him to like enjoy something but he was connected to something in his DNA who who he was and something much more Baseline truth and that's why he was such a good detective so that but there's an island as much as that company can be I said earlier on that Amazon trip I it wouldn't en jooin the company there's Parts I think that I maybe gave to myself to Rus and Cole and also that Rus and Cole's given back to me that are like yeah when you're when you want to pull the parachute CU you can't stand the company that in MCC in your own mind the cratic dialogue is driving you freaking crazy don't pull a parachute stick with it go through it so you were able to walk around with that tormented mind of his tormented I did I I didn't have very much patience for mendacious talk I didn't have as much patience for small talk I wasn't tormented but the character was and you have to embody him so is that I mean does some of that bleed over are you able to uh separate the man you are from the character it's not look am I able to separate yeah I came home to my kids and when they walk in the door and greet me and go what' you do today and you got three kids under 10 years old you don't tell them about the scene where you help someone commit suicide it's just you know so you you turn it into a a parable it actually I've always said this having kids has made me a better actor a better Storyteller because I have to parize certain things you know um and tell it in ways they go oh neat you know um so I did did I go did I bring an I didn't bring torment did I bring introspection into my this characters for me and I think this is true for a lot of actors and actresses we don't it's not a separation if I've got I we each have everyone else in us it's just seeing diving into rust and gold knowing where his mind and heart is from the hand of Nick pelato who wrote the character and wrote the whole series understanding number one what the hell am I saying what's he talking about then going deeper into that well that this person really believes that what does that say about how they move then I'm going all of a sudden well who was that in me what part of my left brain is locked into that what part of my Reptilian Brain is latched on to that where this other stuff is non-negotiable then I just live in that and it's I always taught it like a 70s equalizer remember the old Morant equalizers you can you and you move up your 500 hkz you move up your 60 you just re you re re uh uh uh rebalance The Equalizer and we all have so it's just going to those parts of me where I'll turn up the volume some parts of the base the treble on The Equalizer and turn down other parts of myself and I'll I'm not coming home tormented as rust and Cole am I coming home seeing torment where it should be seen am I reading the news differently or things coming out of the news and catching my eye as being [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] or lies or truth that is just hard and going yep yeah I'm seeing it through a different lens but I'm seeing my own life through a different lens a lens that was opened up and an aperture that was opened up through Rus and Cole I mean the the the process of being an actor and actress I guess is a really interesting way to be a philosopher of human nature yeah I mean it's it's an incredible in it dive into the humanities yeah and all the Allies Y and philosophy and as I said I've going to going to as I opened up that question like that the VAC the being on an island is a vacation I am also conscious for five months when I'm playing Rus and Cole that this this is an interesting back I I've never I was as strong spiritually with my relationship with God when I did True Detective as I've ever been why is that okay which you would say wait a minute in some ways that's a those are antonyms where no but but my I I I pretty sure pretty safely can say that my own strength of spirit in my own personal life Matthew's lifetime gave me the confidence to go further away deeper into the torture and deeper into the but but still he was still always going after truth that was the thing he was not he was not an not an evil man I don't even know if you can call him a non-believer but he was always going after the truth and the truth burned and he would take the scar and get burned for it he die for it that something was actually biblical about that you know and and so but I but I I don't think it's coincidence that I was had so much J of diving into the depths of that tortured character because I trusted that when I go out I'll come up the other side it's always like jumping in a pool of water and can you trust you'll come up the other side and not you you go play a criminal you you trust you're not going to come out the other side a tyrant in real life you just go ah glad I got to go do that came out and I'm still alive got all my faculties I'm not in jail I'm you know whatever it is it's and so my own spirituality at that time of hell that definitely I think gave me a certain trust and confidence to go further into to the dark it was announced that you'll be starring in a Yellowstone spin-off show what do you think about the uh Cowboy ethos that permeates Yellowstone and other shows created by Taylor Sheridan you're a Texan I am a Texan yeah what do you think about that like philosophy and way of life I admire the Simplicity of it I mean one bit one way you could explain Yellowstone and a and CER roles What will what will man do to protect land and family yeah in a world that's trying to encroach in a world where there's a cowboy ethos that deems trespassing more clear earlier yeah than than other other hats um I admire that Simplicity of right and wrong and that the the Simplicity of that right and wrong doesn't always uh correlate coincide with the law no it's above the law it's you mentioned something earlier I remember where it was in the conversation it's a little bit like okay if the law I ain't handling this I am yeah and then it is the law is not going to handle this therefore I am and then it is I'm handling this law talk to them when you get to them I'm handling this there's a honesty to that it just seems of course it's dangerous because uh it's a slippery slope uh the because of the power in that power corrupts it can be a slippery slope where you completely disregard the law and you can hurt a lot of people but when done right you know there feels to be um something really authentic and human about that protect family protect land Above All Else yeah look I you know this is a broader question but I'm going to piggyback it off this back to the dreams in reality and then evolved species and how what can we doing creating a digital God and Ai and these communities and friends that challenge us and think like us we like to hang out with are do you think we're less evolved species than we give oursel credit for do you think we give oursel credit for being more evolved than we actually are I think we do I do I think we need to admit that I think probably the cowboy ethos is uh is a step in towards admitting that and that's why it's so appealing to people kind of wakes them up to realize that we are uh we're not so far from our ancestors that uh the values of loyalty are really important um Trust on the basic human level how do you know if you can trust someone I don't know if I can trust someone well I don't know a trick to it I do not know a trick to it but I do come in as I believe you do with high Trust I come in with a um I'm told sometimes I think I'm told that I trust too much sometimes have you been hurt have you been betrayed um and if you have has that like hurt your willingness to trust no it hurt and I put that person and those people in another category back here and do my best not to let them know that it bothered me at all but I know when I'm with those people but a new person you're still willing to no I'm not going to do that I think that's just that's that's the beginning of cynicism which I think is a horrible disease of getting older I'm not going to do that so you're fighting cynicism off as much as you can no way no way no way and there's no there's no there's no residual in it yeah there's no win yeah um it's easy it's clever gets the laugh at the the party but uh and and and if it sleeps well it should me don't get comfortable in the cynicism I I have to ask you about being a Texan you're like when I think Texas I think Matthew MC uh what's it mean to be a Texan to you I recently moved to Austin Texas some uh two years in all right all right welcome what's it mean to be a Tex educate us Texas is about independence politically Texas is not about Republican or Democrat it's about Independence Independence of spirit sovereignty uh uh um Texas is about exploration one one of the things I love about Texas is I run into so many Texans around the world you Texans are taught to go be Tech conservative are learn your learn learn who we are then go go explore Pioneer journey and hopefully you come on back with some goods and some stories you Texan and underneath that is this kind of um freedom of um being an individual in the in in the full meaning of that word yeah well Texas is liberal on your entrance very liberal on your entrance less regulation hey welcome hi trust hi trust sir Welcome to our state come on in yes yes yes but if you like sheat steel yeah we're conservative on our consequences oh Dam that's a good line um that you've uh briefly pondered running for governor I don't know if that's in your future I hope it is uh you had a few good lines about it do you think about that kind of stuff about what the future holds in terms of uh political office I don't think about it as terms of political office I've I've graduated to a broader larger thought of what's my future hold and and and where and would I be most useful as a leader I think that's a fair word whether that's thought whether that's the leader of my family right now as a parent as a father um the leader of people that work with me um politics it's it's it's I'm not going to say it's it's because it's not it's not small and I'm not don't I don't that's that's why I say that out loud it's not small I do think it needs to re-engineer and redefine what its purpose is before because it's just chasing its own tail right now with the with the with the with the the two parties uh that are seem to me to be completely about just invalidation of the opposition instead of vision of themselves um so I think it needs redefinition of what it is because it is important that's why I mean that's why I said I don't mean small it's it's it needs to think bigger about what it is and how how it's useful when it seeks to invalidate it's small when it seeks Vision it's it can be big yes well one's affirmative one's going into that cynicism we were talking about yep you know and inv validation of any opposing thought or maybe that were even opposing opposition is a is a is a is is an arrogant term that's too strong a lot of times not even opposition alternative other than another way of thinking about it oh could both be true oh how can we parlay those two ideas um you know this the the one of the challenges with these ideas of third party or meet in the middle it's kind of got this historic notion of of being oh well Kuma it's sort of Mr in between kind of go which way the wind blows I think done in the right way it's the and it doesn't have to be under a third party's name necessarily but it's actually an incredibly rebellious position right now and it's actually and I love sports it's tactically the place with which to move most advantageously I think of their free safety in the game of football they're in the middle of the field field and they're deep mhm they choose to defend left or right according to the play that's been called by the offense similar to the offense the running back you read the defense and then you're going to run right to run left to go away from that opposition it's it's a tactical spot to be truly independent and respond and respond so do you think you have a role in that in political officers I don't know I it's on it's on mine it's not out of my mental mental box um and I gave it real sincere thought and discernment for over a year and it's a wonderful whether whether I end up whether I end up getting in politics or not it was a wonderful exercise one that if anyone else got time to do it do it to ask yourself what you would do if you were CEO yeah of a state CEO of a Nation CEO of the world that's a great thing to go you want to get your values line you want to admit where you lie and throw yourself some pop quizzes and what if this phone call comes at 4: am. what you got you know who you want to surround yourself with it's really great questions to ask and I think has helped me at a more micro level be a better father and a better man taking considerations that I did not maybe taken as seriously before considering it um I don't know if that's in my future I got you know useful is a big word it's got to be I I would have to be useful I have to be useful in the right way and is that my Lane to be most useful it's a good question for leader to ask how can I be useful I have to ask you about Interstellar so I think it's an incredible film I've seen it inspires so many scientists and Engineers it's just uh philosopher everybody humans it EXP space travel physics of SpaceTime human nature Human Condition human connection um how's that film expanded your understanding of uh the the universe yeah and our place in it yeah well it's the uh it's got the old Mr Mayor on the corner how big is that cloud metaphor in it because that was the character I played Cooper's that was the existential question for him head down practical stay here be a father to my children but his dream before his children were to go explore space so when he's taking that truck out and the countdown's going down that's the the hinge of the existential question that we all face in some form um the the the the the sense of time I which I think everyone loves that sense of where time can run at different speeds and I there's a incredible scene where Cooper's a father's getting video feed from his children who have aged and he's realizing he's missed all that yeah there it it you know I mean overall that that that concept makes me consider and imagine we talk about mystical successes instead of engineered ones like the engineered ones that there there's there's ethos from that film and the and and what Nolan put into that film and theories that make me go yeah what does any of this matter what do we maybe we are maybe we're AI makes me go may maybe this is all it's already all been it's already all been written what's happening right now in this blip of time you're here 53 years so far we'll see how many we get um what other parallel timelines are happening out there do is it is it small-minded of us to Define life on other planets as only something that can live within a climate that has water in this amount of o2 those terms may be uh too too small thing what do you mean who were we saying only life has to have water and this amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide I don't maybe that's maybe there's a whole redefinition of the ingredients that other life forms need um it's sure in a similar way to contact which is a movie I did with Bob and meccas um inspires me that the universe is more active and Lively and God's backyard's bigger than I thought and wow that's exciting and and you know people go now yeah you believe in EXT terestrial life I said yes man I I think it'd be arrogant not to I sure hope so you think there's alien civilizations all out there intelligent ones just far in far on the distant Stars I I hope so and I think we it's possible may have many Among Us right here why and and I go for the the the why not in that just to keep that that train of thought open to the to learn and and and and and and consider you know those existential questions I think be arrogant not to there's so many hundreds of billions of planets just in our galaxy just in ours I can't imagine there's not life out there and um but I suspect it's very different like you said than we are and we have to have a humility to open up our eyes to how different life could be and if and when we cross it unlike we've had tendency to do when we try to go with some Nation takeovers um I think it would be our inherent glitch to go in believing that any other life form civilization wants to take over territories to go into it with thinking that okay this is an opposition I I mean I I think that's a a human trait of ours and to consider that another life form would have an interest that more land or more territory is good for them I think is I think is a shallow idea I don't think there I think of it more like you know when I think of Heaven those considerations are not in in in anyone's mind heart or intent in the heaven that I think of you know so in other civilization these things I I don't I mean I I I hope that we would just see and we learn it would be the natural side of welcoming it wouldn't be a primate response to no I have fire and you're coming over trying to put it out or I have food and you're trying to steal my food I don't I I don't think it would be I think it's a shallow thought to think that oh it's going to be about ownership and we would be trespassing I think it would be I don't think they're would have a sense of borders as we do I just hope we humans are smart enough to uh detect and to see aliens because because of how different they are you know we don't we often have a very narrow definition of what is intelligence you know it's very possible that trees extremely intelligent if we kind of zoom out at a different time scale a different like just look at stuff in a from a bigger perspective that that's outside of being so human Centric it's a great quote that someone told me this astrop physicist told me this how accurate is or not someone else can argue the Val validity of what I'm about to say or not but I thought it really was a perspective grabber for me like look see the universe was created at midnight humans came around at 11:59 and 36 seconds I love little analogies are that put that frame like that make oh yeah pale blue dot there it is that perspective something so relaxing and empowering about that at at the at the same time and humbling but confidence boosting you know allows forgiveness allows ambition um I just love the perspective of that that that picture to picture it that way in our timeline do you hope humans become a multiplanetary species as we're trying to do as the SpaceX is pushing forward traveling out to Mars potentially colonizing Mars colonizing other planets yeah I'm yeah go expl I I love the ambition of it I love the uh um pioneering nature of it I love the extension of what we consider is our backyard becoming more four-dimensional like that not at the expense of we still got stuff to take care of we got Gardens to tend right here and sure as hell not to go not to quit on us to go oh let's get out of here because this isn't really working no no no no no no no we got a tithe we're still supposed to pay here we don't that's part of this pressure testing us as a civilization and species whether you call that restoration order or whether you call that let's figure out how to adapt best we can uh no I not at the expense of quitting here on Earth but let a few a few select folks explore yeah cuz that's like uh God said go for it please one of the coolest things that we humans do is kind of embodies the human Spirit reach out into the unknown but it's hard I mean as Interstellar shows and so on it's well Elon talks about it this is not going to be a weekend Daisy trip and he's just speculating how hard it could be much harder in different ways that he doesn't understand yet you know yeah well that you know that dance between the impossible and the inevitable that's definitely there with uh what SpaceX is doing with all the folks who are trying to become a multi species are doing it's really hard it's like build rockets that fight off gravity at a cost effective way is really hard SpaceX is close to being bankrupt several times it's just hard but it's also inspiring to that some people are just crazy enough bold enough to keep trying yeah what advice would you give to Young Folks what advice would I give them in high school and college that are um thinking of how to make a their way in this world if you haven't already can you can you define what you have an innate ability for and match that with what you're willing to hustle to get yeah sometimes we have an innate ability but we don't want to work for it we take it for granted and we end up doing something that may work they pay the bills they get us buy dayto day but we don't really like it we have trouble finding way to enjoy it definitely don't love it and then sometimes we don't know what our inability is and we're hustling and working our tail off and breaking a sweat to do something that we really aren't that good at on an inate level and that's a good challenge and you can work and become good at something that you don't have an innate ability for but if you can match those two what do you have an innate ability to because which we have an innate ability to do when we do that well we do kind of enjoy it yeah and one of the things that requires us to kind of be really honest with yourself at what your inate ability is cu often times there's a lot of noise when you're growing up people telling you what you're good at not good at like really you have to look at yourself listen to yourself that inner like a deep rigorous self-analysis of what am I actually good at not what I hope to be good at but what I'm actually good at right and then if you look at that and you can define those two hopefully there's you can you can activate it in a way where there's a demand for what you supply you found love with Camila Elvis m hey uh what advice would you give to people on how to do just that how to find love this wonderful subject's been discussed since the beginning of time hadn't it love it um so I can tell you what things I've kind of learned and I'm still learning you know love's one of those mtic successes it doesn't make sense it you know when I was when I was before I met Camila I had I was coming on to my late 30s as much as I'm not uh a person that is Guided by timelines I was my life had not really added up to what I thought it was going to be relationship wise I thought by that time I would have met the woman I loved get married and started family and that hadn't happened and I did find myself doing that thing I was doing at the Amazon looking around the corner any perspective possible female I met that I was attracted to I was like maybe this the one I make the joke but it's true it's I get every red light I'm like checking out who's next to me in the produce section at the supermarket I'm like check who's in in the produce section you know it's like looking yeah when you're in that zone you can also be a little intrusive you can trespass on people's you can get outside of yourself you can be overly impressed and not as involved and have your own Constitution and sit back and therefore if you're outside of yourself you're less attractive to your Poss mate I've got a series of dreams that I've written about but I had one then that was very spiritual that was me as a 88 year 88y old Bachelor who never got married and it was a beautiful dream where on paper I thought that should be a nightmare it wasn't what that dream did for me was allowed me to go you may not find the woman for you and get married and have a life with her that may not be and for the first time in life I was okay with that m not more than intellectually spiritually I was grounded I was like okay then I'm moving through the world and on this particular night as myself not intruding I was inviting I did see her move across the room and did not say who is that I said what is that and then did mooved to call her across the room so I did invite but I was not outside of myself and I was able to be myself with her what my eyes saw everything that she turned out to be when the lens got zoomed in more details got known and we began to talk and got more intimate and closer together and spend more time came true and then some but not every single thing that I imagined when I saw her move across the room turned out to be true and then some in the just the image um we found a had a moral similar moral bottom line about life each other how we treat ourselves what we respect what our own constitutions were with had similar uh um um perspectives on raising children which is very important to me and her and then we just enjoyed each other's company yeah and we laughed together and we support each other we promoted more of each other and we lit each other's fire and we if one was rolling we kept dishing you go go go again take the next shot more more more more this was a biggie too getting excited for each other's success yes yes to be able think it's very important we all have jealousy I get it but it's very important to be able if you can be happy for your lover when they succeed or are succeeding or are across the room with the party laughing with the stranger MH to be happy for them when it has nothing to do with you she was I would be away she would the questions and the talks we would have she was happy for me about how excited I was about my day and my day had nothing to do with her yeah she wasn't there and I found myself not telling myself to be happy for her but being really really happy for her when she would tell me about something that happened that day with her and as much as I went through my head oh I'd have been great if I would have been there I was like no I don't want trespass on that that you had that yeah dependent of me Bravo that that's a choice you make not to not to give any time to the jealousy to the very natural jealousy that we humans have it sure doesn't have any I don't see the residuals in in it true I've got it I've had it and I have it I just don't you know I I haven't seen where it hasn't you payback I got to ask you the biggest possible question what's the meaning of this whole thing oh what's the meaning of life right Matthew MC why why are we here I don't know why we're here I prescribe to in a religious sense the restoration order we're here to restore order in religious sense I really I purchased that and love that incentive and love that that view but I don't really know why we're here but I do know to go back to the front we are here that part's inevitable so now let's flip the script and go to the why not just keep living what what what are we doing the base of everything can we can argue all at the base of it I can get all I can come up with is well just keep living man I mean what else are we supposed to do when we don't have any idea what to do when we know exactly what we want to do make it matter even when it doesn't matter that matters not for what I don't know for the fun of it that matters yeah our ability to create meaning and Beauty in the mundane in the Absurd it's kind of cool yeah and we share it with each other yeah we get excited yeah and we create some pretty cool stuff along the way I mean I I say I'm confident enough and I might be arrogant of me to say but I I I I I do believe that we're here to each generation have a small Ascension yeah or else what what's it for and we're not really sure what the Ascension is towards just kind of up no just I just think it's up I do think it's just up I do think that it is definitely arrogant to think that we as a species or generation or people or Humanity are going to reach the top of the ascended staircase and go t I think that's a I think that is not only false but I think it's full-hearted and I think it's a recipe for being having more angst and and even cynicism we talked about and unrest and lack of seeing Beauty and joy in this life while we're in it um I think Life's a verb live it as best we can hopefully I mean I don't know sometimes I'm just I don't have a grand plan man I'm just trying to connect the damn dot I'm confused frustrated I don't know what I don't feel any gravity or building or lineage to towards what I'm doing and I'm just like going what's that Peterson line if you don't believe in having do you do what you can to get as far away from hell as possible sometimes yeah it's a
