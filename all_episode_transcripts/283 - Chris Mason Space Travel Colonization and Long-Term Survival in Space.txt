would that make you sad to die in mars looking back at the planet you were born on no i think it would be actually in some ways it may be the best way to die knowing that you're in the first wave of people expanding the reach into the stars it'd be an honor the following is a conversation with chris mason professor of genomics physiology and biophysics at cornell he and colleagues do some of their research out in space experiments on space missions that seek to discern the molecular basis of changes in the human body during long-term human space travel on this topic he also wrote an epic book titled the next 500 years engineering life to reach new worlds that boldly looks at what it takes to colonize space far beyond our planet and even journey out towards livable worlds beyond our solar system this is the lex friedman podcast to support it please check out our sponsors in the description and now dear friends here's chris mason you wrote a book called the next 500 years engineering life to reach new worlds and you dedicated to quote to all humans and any extinction aware sentience how fundamental is awareness of death and extinction to the human condition i think this is actually one of the most human specific traits and features that we have it's actually maybe one of the few things that we only we have and no one else has so it sounds scary sounds like what people often don't like to think about their death except now and again or at funerals or to recognize their mortality but if you do it at a species-wide level it's something that is actually an exemplary human-specific trait that you're exhibiting you think about something that is the loss of not just your life or your family or everyone you see but everyone like you and that is i dedicate it because i think we might not be the last sentients to have this awareness i'm actually hoping we'll just be the first but as far as we know we're the only and i think this is the part of the moral thrust for the book is that we're the only ones that have this awareness that gives us a duty that only we can exercise so far so we definitely contemplate our own mortality at the individual level it is true when you wrote it it it was really powerful to realize for me that we do contemplate our extinction and that that is a creative force so the at the individual level contemplating your own death is a creative force yes like i have a deadline yes but the contemplating the extinction of the whole species i suppose that stretches through human history that's many of the sort of uh subtext of religious ideas is that like if we screw this up it's gonna be over forever and revelation and every religious text has some view of either the birth or the death of the world as they know it but it was very abstract it was uh fiction almost in some cases complete fiction of what you hope or think might happen but it's become much more quantified and much more real i think in the past well several hundred years and especially in the past few decades where we can see you know a sense of responsibility and a planetary scale so when we think about like say terraforming mars that would just be the second planet we've engineered at a planetary scale we're already doing it for this one just not that well well yeah that's right so we're like a bunch of ants uh extinction aware sentience ants that are busy trying to terraform this planet to make it uh habitable so we can flourish and then you say that it's our duty to expand beyond earth to expand to other planets to uh to find a a good backup off-site backup solution why the word duty it's an interesting word duty is something that usually puts people to sleep i'll say that's how duty you know it's duty is a bit like death people don't often like to really think what you wake up in the morning what is what was my duty today most people there are some people who think about every day people in active military service wake up it's a very concrete sense of duty to country sometimes you can think about it though in terms of family you feel a duty towards your spouse your kids your parents you feel a real duty to them because you want them to to flourish and to be safe so we do have this sense of duty but you don't you know very much like death you don't think about it actively usually it's something that just becomes embedded in your day-to-day existence but i think about duty because this is people think about duties for themselves but there has never been a real overarching duty that we all feel as a species for each other and for generations that haven't yet been born and i think i want people to have a sense of the same love and compassion and you know fighting even to the tooth and nail with the way you protect your family the way you'd fight for a country for example to feel the same way towards the rarity and preciousness of life and feel that sense of duty towards particularly extinction aware life which is just us so far this ability that we have this awareness of not only our our own frailty which of course is often talked about and climate change and people think about pandemics but other species that we sometimes cause extinction but very soon will be even species like the woolly mammoth colossals or recent startups that's doing that on their advisory report and it's it might happen in three or four years so it's the interesting point in history where we can actually think about preventing death at a species-wide level and even resurrecting things that we have killed or that have gone away which brings its own series of questions of just as when you delete something from an ecosystem adding something can be completely catastrophic and so there are no real guidelines yet on how to do that but the technology now exists which is pretty extraordinary yeah i just been working on uh backup and restoring uh databases quite a bit recently and uh you can do quite a lot of damage when you restore them properly when we bring back the madness it might be uh you have to be careful bringing that back yes like the best of science the best of engineering is both dangerous and exciting and that's why you have to have the best people but also the most morally grounded people yes pushing us forward yeah but on the point of duty there's a kind of sense that there's something special to humanity to human beings that we want to preserve and if that that little flame whatever that is dies that will be a real shame for the universe what is that what is special about human beings what is special about the human condition that we want to preserve that's why do we matter there are some people who think we don't there are some people say well humans take take it or leave it they think they're misanthropes so the book is on the one sense a call to misanthropes to hopefully shake them out of their slumber but there's some people the words and throw me just people that uh dislike humanity there they're just again they're all just they're called nihilist donnie that's a shout out for big lebowski they're like nothing matters and why does any they can and they just apply it more particularly to humans but there are endless reasons i think to cherish and celebrate what humans have done at the same time many things we've done awfully and genocide and and you know nuclear weapons testing on unsuspecting citizens of remote islands definitely things we've done bad but the poetry the music the uh engineering feats the you know getting to the moon and eventually already rovers on mars these extraordinary feats that humans have already accomplished interested really a sense of beauty i think is something that is uh you know you can't ask ants or cockroaches about their favorite paintings or maybe if you could uh it would be very different from ours but in either case there's a unique perspective that we carry and i think so that that's something even just the old age-old question in biology i'm a geneticist so this comes up a lot of what makes humans unique and so is it bipedalism is it our intelligence is it tool making is it language all those things i just listed other species have some degree of those those traits so it's a question of degree not of type of trait that defines you know humans a little bit but i think for the extinction awareness that is a uniquely human trait that is to our knowledge no other species or entity or ai or sentience that carries that awareness of the frailty of life of our own life but all life and maybe it is that awareness the frailty of life that allows us to be so urgently creative create beauty create innovation it just seems like if you just measure humans are able to create some sort of subjectively beautiful things and i see science that way i see engineering that way and ants are less efficient at that they also create beautiful things but less uh aggressively less innovation less building like standing on the shoulders of giants building on top of each other over and over and over where you're getting like these like uh hierarchical systems where you greater and greater levels of abstraction then you use ideas to communicate those ideas and you share those ideas and all of a sudden you have the rockets going on into space yeah which ants have been building the same structures for millions and millions of years with no real change and so that is the key differentiator yet yeah that's right we've got an experiment going right now and maybe it'll uh change but well yeah we will bring up some extreme uh organisms another thing you're uh interested in okay one interesting thing that comes up much later in your book is something i also haven't thought of and it's quite inspiring which is the heat death in the universe is something worth fighting against like that's also an engineering problem yes you know you kind of uh the i mean you seriously look at the next 500 years and that's such a beautiful thing you know seriously we'll talk about like the uncertainty involved with that and all the different trajectories but to to seriously look at that and then to seriously look at like what happens when the sun runs out what happens when the uh the universe comes to an end like we have an opportunity and a kind of duty like you said to fight against that and that was so inspiring to me to think wait maybe we'll actually that's a worthy thing to think about maybe we can prevent it actually right the come up with the best known understanding current of how things end the you know we have we kind of are building an intuition and data and models of the way the universe is the way it started the way it's going to end so our best model of the end let's start thinking about how that could be prevented how that could be avoided how that could be channeled and misdirected and you can pivot it somehow um that's really inspiring that's really powerful i never really thought about i thought that you know eventually all things end and that was the kind of melancholic notion behind all of it you know none of this matters in a way just uh to me that's also inspiring and to enjoy the moment to really live in the moment you know that because that is truly where beauty exists is in the moment but there is a long lasting aspect to beauty that is part of the engineering ethic which is like tell me what the problem is and we're going to solve it so what do you think about that the the long scale beyond 500 years is do humans have a chance absolutely i think we have the the best chance of any species and actually the best chance that humanity's ever had so i think a lot of people fear that we could that we can or will kill ourselves actually my favorite question i asked to ask at the end of every interview for every potential graduate student medical student faculty whoever i'm interviewing for whatever reason yes the last question is well how long do you think that humans or our evolutionary derivatives will last and the answers are shockingly wide ranging some people say i think we've only got 100 years left or some people say billions some people say as long as the universe lasts but to the person who once said as a medical student applicant who said i think we've only got 100 juice left and i was like really for all of humanity everything will be gone in 100 years and he said yes and i said well well sweet jesus man why go to med school why would he why not go sell bananas on the beach and then he said i really want to make the last you know few hundred years count really matter and i said oh well that's actually kind of sort of hopeful in a really dark way but i i think we've never been better situated to actually last for the long term we have even though we've also never been at the greater risk of being able to destroy ourselves ever since really the first nuclear test when they uh tony orb has a great book about this called the precipice where the precipice for humanity is at one point we made technologies that we weren't sure whether or not they would destroy the earth or the entire universe so the math was incomplete and there was too much air but they tested the bomb anyway but it's an extraordinary place as a species to think we now have something in our hands that may destroy the earth and possibly a chain reaction that destroys the whole universe let's try it anyway as a as a stage that we're at as a species but with that power comes an ability to get to other planets to survive long term and when you think about the heat depth that just becomes that's a an ad infinitum question if you keep thinking well we survive we go to the next sun and then you go to the next sun eventually the question will be well if you just keep doing that forever at some point the universe either continues to expand or it could collapse back in itself and the heat death is more likely at this point where it just keeps expanding expanding everything it's too far away but even in that case i think if we had a fundamental knowledge of physics and space time that you could try and restructure quite literally the shape of the universe to prevent it i think we would i think we would want to survive i think you know unless we had done the math and we think that there's a greater chance that the next universe would form and make more life maybe we would but even then i think humans have always wanted to survive and and you could argue maybe should survive because and are able to engineer systems that example survive yeah yeah and always have yeah so what is this though the tsar bomb yeah the hydrogen yeah there's there's nothing more terrifying and somehow inspiring than watching the mushroom cloud of a nuclear explosion it's like humans are capable of this they're capable of leveraging the power of nature to completely obliterate everything and and to create propulsion i mean most the voyager spacecraft are nuclear powered because it's still in many ways the most efficient way to get a tiny amount of physical material and make power out of it you know so they're still slowly drifting they're past the heliosphere they're out in now into interstellar space and they're nuclear powered so it's like any tool or technology it's a it's a tool or a weapon depending on how you hold it are we alone in the universe chris mason what do you think so the presumption that you've just mentioned is let's just focus on our thing yeah for now for now well i think we as far as we know with no other sentient life on the universe that we've found yet and and i think there's probably bacterial life out there just because we found it everywhere we've looked on earth it is and there's you know halophilic organisms that can survive in extreme salts there are psychrophiles that in extreme cold there's you know basically organisms can survive in really almost any possible environment you can adapt and find a way to live but as far as we know we're the only sentient ones and i think this is the famous the drake equation or you know how many where is everyone is that what enrico fermi said is the why haven't we heard from anyone there are these other life forms i actually think the question is wrong to phrase it that way because the unit the earth has only been here for 4.5 billion years and we and you know life maybe only for a few billion of those years complex life only for several hundred years 100 million years of life we've actually had you know in humans only the past few million years since our last common ancestor so it's not that much time but if you think even further back the universe hasn't had that much time itself to cool and create atoms and have them spread around the the universe right so the current estimates 13.8 billion years of just the whole universe but it spent the first five or six of those billion years really just like cooling and making enough of the stars to then make the atoms that would come from supernovas so i actually think we might be the first or sit one of the very few or one of the early life forms but the universe itself hasn't had that much time to make life in the integra and a galactic and universal time frame you needed billions of years for the elements to be created and then distributed and we're only really in the i think the last few billion years where i think even life could have been made so i think the question of wherever is everyone is the wrong question i think the question is i think we are the first ones at the party let's set up the liquor let's set up the food we i just think we're the first ones at the party of life but more people are coming one of the early attendees to the party yeah or maybe the for as far as we know the first but maybe we'll get into the local pocket of the universe um because the parties then expand and you it overflows and then there's a mosh pit and then you know you bump into the other galaxy uh i think it's i think the question should be we know when else is everyone getting here instead of where is everyone i think i think we've just started on the genesis of life in the universe yeah so not not worry have they or not more about when and who and how do we set up the party right and then how do we help them i think it's an interesting other moral question is do we you know the a lot of star trek episodes you the prime directive is you do not interfere with another planet if you could pass by a planet i think it's time to also revisit that because what if what if you go by a planet and we think that with as far as we can tell with enough certainty that they would never be able to leave their planet and then the sun eventually would engulf that planet wherever that planet might be in some solar system but if we had a way to help them their culture their science their technology everything about a different species to survive would we not interview interfere i think that would actually be wrong to say well we can save this this life here and we decide not to we decide after millions and billions of years past and we know the sign will engulf that planet like what will happen with our planet and we don't interfere that's you know watching a train hit someone on the tracks and not moving the train so i mean in terms of the effort of humans becoming multi-planetary species in terms of priorities how much would you allocate to trying to make contact with aliens and getting their help and if we look at the next 500 beyond years and just versus option number two really just focusing on setting up the party on our own engineering our on our own um the genome the biology of humanity the ai collaborating with humans just all the engineering challenges and opportunities that we're um we're exploring i'm focused in my lab of course a lot on the engineering of genomes the monitoring of astronauts during long missions uh you know reaching out to other aliens we've been doing reach out to aliens since the first radio waves been broadcast so we're doing some of it but to do them really made it sound like your lab is mostly focused on biology but you also reach out occasionally occasionally when they visit they have they bring their whiskey you know we have a drink but the uh i think we we can do we've been broadcasting into space for you know at this point almost a century getting close to and you know so but it's not been structured so i think it's very cheap and easy to send out structured messages um like what carl sagan wrote about in contact doing prime numbers and sending those out to indicate intelligence uh so there's things we can do that i think are very cheap and very easy so we should do some of that we can walk and chew gum at the same time this is one of the biggest critiques people often say of space research and even space flight in general is too expensive shouldn't we solve poverty shouldn't we cure diseases and the answer is always as it always has been is that you can walk and chew gum at the same time you can pass the civil rights act and go to the moon in the same decade you can improve and and get rid of structural inequality while getting to the moon and mars in this decade so i think i think we can do both yeah and they kind of help each other there's sometimes criticism of like ridiculous science like studying penguins or something or studying the patterns of birds or fish and so on some congressman stands up and says this is a waste of taxpayer dollars and then but someone says oh but we and for example crispr was pure research for 25 years now it's a household word and students are editing genomes in high school but it was just pure research on weird bacteria living actually in salt uh hyper saline lakes and rivers for decades and then eventually became a massive therapeutic which is like a curing of diseases in this past year and there's stuff that you discover as part of the research that you didn't anticipate they have nothing to do with the actual research like uh oceanography uh is one of the interesting things about that whole field is that it's a huge amount of data and neuroscience too actually so you could discover computer science things like machine learning things or even data storage manipulation distributed compute things by having to forcing yourself to get something done about on the oceanography side that's how you invent the internet and and and all those kinds of things so to me aliens looking for aliens out there in the universe is a motivator that just inspires inspires everybody young people old people scientists artists engineers entrepreneurs everybody the somehow the that line between fear and beauty because we're aliens are like perfectly merged basically because this we don't know i mean for you let's start talking about primitive alien life are you excited by it or are you terrified i want to make a lotion out of it i think it'd be great if it's alien life assuming it's safe but i'm very excited it doesn't have to be you just said a half sentence presuming it's safe that's the fundamental question so if you could yes presuming it's safe so i think you know we have this uh we're this beginning of some planetary protection is happening now is we're going to send we're bringing rocks back from mars in 2033 if all goes according to plan but there's always a danger what if you bring this back what if it's alive what if it will kill all of humanity or michael creighton wrote a book the andromeda strain about this very idea and we could but it hopefully won't and the only way you can you know really gauge that is the same way we do with any infectious agent here on earth right if it's a new pathogen a new organism you do it slowly carefully you often do it with levels of containment so you know and it's gonna be probably have to be where some pioneers go and would be for example on mars there might be other organisms there that only get activated once there's an ambient temperature and more humidity then suddenly the first settlers and mars are encountering a strange new fungus or something that's not even like a fungus because it might be a different clade of life a different branch of life and could be very dangerous or it could be very inert i mean most of life on earth on earth is not really dangerous or harmful let me go back down this most of life on earth is neither harmful nor beneficial to you it's just they're making its own way in the universe just trying to survive it's when you know it's inside of you and replicating yourselves and destroying your cells like a virus like like like covid xrcv2 that it becomes a big problem of course but it's you know just doesn't really have agency it's just trying to get by and so for example most the bacteria on the table on your skin in the subway are pretty inert they're just you know people hanging around for the ride and actually just because we're talking so much trash about viruses most viruses are don't bother humans they're phages almost all the vast majority of viruses are phages there's this this battle in the biology that is really dorky is that bacteria think that they're the most you know people study bacteria think the bacteria are the most important because there's trillions and trillions of them they run a lot of our own biology in our body that but then people who study phages they say well there's 10 times more phages than the bacteria which can attack the bacteria and destroy them as well so phage people think that they run the world but we need them both uh what do you think about viruses all right so because you said alien organisms wouldn't we encounter something like bacteria something like viruses as the first alien life form are they first of all are viruses alive or not so by the book definition if you pick up a biology textbook they'd say technically no because they don't have the ability to self-replicate independently but i would think if you restructure how you view what life is it's just autonomously aggregating and replicating of information uh for example ai at some point what if there's an ai platform that we could consider alive like at what point would you allow it to say it's alive and i think we have the same definitional challenge there is that if it can continually propagate instructions for its own existence then it is a version of living i think you know viruses don't get that category because they can't do it on their own but they are a version of life i'd say but probably not alive well they are expressing themselves and doing so on occasion quite powerfully in human civilization so um like you said at which point our ai systems allowed to say we're life we we are allowed humans must allow them and the viruses didn't ask for permission to express themselves to humans they just kind of they just kind of did yeah we didn't have to allow them are they overall though exciting or terrifying to you as somebody who has studied viruses well whenever given two options there's always two more you could do both or neither so here i'll say they're both uh terrifying and exciting i think to me more exciting than terrifying i think if i had to make that sandwich and how many layers are you know meat versus cheese there's a lot more cheese of excitement and meat isn't it well i love both so it's a hell of a delicious sandwich you quote president dwight d eisenhower in your book quote plans are useless but planning is essential and you provide a thought experiment called entropy goggles can you describe this thought experiment happily i i do this almost every day somewhere when i'm sitting in a given room i will uh well a quick comment about that quote actually for all the nasa planning meetings for the twin study and other missions that was often the quote that goes put up on the wall before we'd sit down for the day to plan the mission it was that quote which is useless which i thought was hilarious for a official nasa meeting but it was because you need to have a plan but you have to know that plan might change and so i think uh that's just a quick the context for that quite craig kundra who's a leader at nasa's headquarters now i would always put that first slide up and i'm like hmm this meeting is either going to go really well or really bad i don't know what's about to happen but but it's a inspiring quote because it's very true in any case the entropy goggles is a thought experiment i detail in in my book which is if you just sit in a room any room wherever you are and and imagine what it will look like in 10 years 100 years 500 years or even thousands of years it is a wonderfully terrifying and exciting exercise against definitely both because he realized the transience of everything that you think of what might survive almost everything that you're looking at will probably not be there in hundreds of years uh it will be you know it fairly degraded or it might be changed altered completely different moved it is just it's that trait though of humans to just sit there and project into the future it's easily you know really seamlessly with whatever you're doing and previously is is powerful because it shows the you know what can change and what should change in some cases but also that you know left to you know its own devices the universe would entropy would come take over and really things would decay things would be destroyed but the only thing really preventing i think some of the entropy is is humans these sort of sentient creatures that are aware of extinction like ourselves is really one of the only forces in the universe that's counteracting the second law of thermodynamics this entropy that's always increasing technically we're actually still increasing it because we emit heat and we never have perfect capture of all of energy but were the only things really actively and consciously uh you know resisting it really you could say life in general does this like ants do this when they build their big homes they're rearranging the universe to make a nice place for themselves and they're you know counteracting entropy but we could actually do it in a way that would be at a large scale and for long term so the entropy goggles is just a way to realize how transient everything is and just imagine everything that will decay or change in the room around you so anyone listening if they're listening on a train or they're driving in their car whether someone is listening right now looking around everything can and will change and so you that but then at first it's terrifying to see that oh my gosh everything will decay and go away but then i think it's actually liberating i think wait i can affect this chain i can prevent it or i can affect it or i can improve the change that may occur all by itself say naturally um and so i think it is but is it that awareness again of like you know the frailty of life the ever uh insistence an increase in entropy that you can address though and actually i say the same thing to first-year medical students i teach them genetics i say i point early in the course i say here's all these charts of how the human body decays over time it just and i call it the inexorable march towards molecular oblivion which the students often find they kind of laugh at ah because on all the charts they're 22 years old but older people do not laugh as much of the thought of molecular oblivion but we're all marching towards it to a large degree so this is both a great thought experiment for the environment around you so just looking at all the objects around you that they will dissipate it will disappear with time but then it's also the thing you mentioned which is how can i affect any of the world like uh you're one little creature and it's like uh your life is kind of you get dropped into this ocean and you make a little splash and how do i make it so the splash lasts for uh a little bit longer because it ultimately will uh i mean i suppose the wave will continue indefinitely but it'd be such a small impact it's almost undetectable and so how do i have that impact at all on so many levels i get to experience this as a human like um i recently had had my cold storage uh hacked to where it was locked essentially it wasn't hacked it was locked and so you get to lose all your data so for example if you lose all your data if you lose all your online presence your social media your emails if you like think of all the things you could lose in a fire there's been a lot of fires in the united states if you lose your home yeah it makes you realize wait a minute this is exactly a nice simulation of what will happen anyway yeah eventually uh and that eventually comes pretty quickly and so you it allows you to focus on you know how can i actually affect so what matters what lasts um and what brings me joy i suppose that the ultimate answer is nothing lasts you have to focus on the things in the moment that bring you joy and that have a positive impact on those around you that focusing on something that's long lasting is perhaps i don't know it's it's complicated right because like well it used to be foolhardy to say i want to think legacy is often what people think of as they approach the end of their life what is my legacy what have i done even younger in life but it used to be really foolhardy to say i could affect something that would learn people would build the building architecture i put my name on this building and there i have some sense of immortality but that's a it's a fleeting dream it's not you can't uh we're reaching mortality uh and if you could it would be resource you know taxing on everyone else if you really were but i think it's it's okay i mean the books for the next 500 years but i presume i'll be dead for the vast majority of that time and i i but that is that is actually the liberating state of mortality is you know that you don't have forever so it means what can you do that is the most impactful but you can build things that you said i want to pass this on to the next generation again the most obvious thing we do with this is if people have kids but they don't think of this as a as an intergenerational responsibility to think of it as well i was at the bar one night and i met this hot girl and then things happen or sometimes it's more planned than that but the the there's no overarching sense of weight i could have something that three or four generations from now well that someone will receive this gift that was planned for them long before they were born or gestating and i think we have that capacity and that that can be a version of legacy but it's even okay if if no one knows exactly who started it but that the benefit was was wrought by people you know again hundreds or even thousands of years after you start got it started so i think this is again something that is um only really people that are economically secure can even begin to do this or you can say you know think of maslow's hierarchy of needs where you need to satisfy your physical needs all your structural needs and have shelter and so you know i'm sitting from a position of great privilege to be able to pontificate about what i hope i could do for things for people that come 200 years from now but nonetheless more and more people can do that humanity's never been in a better state quantifiably to be able to start to think about these intergenerational responsibilities yeah this is a interesting balance because like it seems that if you let the ego flare up a little bit that's good for productivity yeah like saying i can somehow achieve immortality if what i do is going to be pretty good but then that's actually being kind of dishonest with yourself because it won't in the long arc of history won't matter right in terms of your own ego but it will have a small piece to play in a larger puzzle and help people yeah people many generations from now and that they said there are all these people who were looking after me before i was ever born i think um it's because it's a bit of just uh even just know what if when you go to a campsite there's a camping rule that you always leave the campsite better than you found it so if if the fire pit was somewhat damaged and you got there you fix it if there was no wood you leave a few bits of logs for the next person who comes and this ethos is something that uh just picked up from camping and so i think if we did that as people the world would be a better place and the world coming ahead would also be that said with these entropy glasses how can you uh see through the fog 500 years is a long time first of all why 500 years most people this is so refreshing because most colleagues and friends i talk to are don't have the guts to think even like 10 years out they start doing wishy-washy kind of statements about well you don't know but it's so refreshing to say all right i know there's so many trajectories that this world can take but i'm going to pick a few and and think through them and think what it's the well it's the quote right plans are useless but planning is essential so what why 500 years so 500 was a little bit of what i felt like i could see clearly through the entropy goggles i i feel like i can't i can't just the contradiction in terms right i can see i mean for example you said chris what's going to happen in a million years well i'll start to describe you know what happens to the the moon will be farther away because it moves several inches away every year and so then eventually you can't have a full lunar eclipse after a while i think about structures of the continental change and things will move i could describe some things but it starts to become so vague it's just not a useful exercise i think if it's too far out if it's too soon that's not that much different from what people just do with the news and say i think that's what the economy might look like over the next year or two years economists are notoriously not held accountable when they have really bad predictions you can make really awful predictions no one seems to care you can just make another one next week so too short is i think not necessarily as helpful but 500 i actually when i was first working on the book and thinking about type i thought well do i do a thousand or two i kept thinking about the main idea was if i were to pick this up 500 years from now what would it look like i changed the number if i pick up a thousand years from now or a hundred and i kept trying to think of what are some time frames where really large-scale changes have happened and so in some sense you could argue that humans been mostly the same for about three or four thousand years and the best example is this you looked at some of the homer's poems or the greek tragedies uh and oedipus for example like humans are really almost identic we're still petty and people you know have affairs and people do things they shouldn't and people it's it's just saying that all those things like it's bad that's just me like you read that it's astounding and in some sense soothing that the greek tragedies of 2 300 years ago are very relatable to what happens in like in every high school right so like you know people that's why you read them in high school like oh that's really a clear part of the human condition so in that sense some things are really permanent but i want to think of a few reasons i chose 500 is that it's a time frame where i could foresee clear development of some biotechnology that will get us to a new place including missions to mars that are planned that will be there and that we'd start to have settlements there on the moon and mars and i could see also that by that time i think we would have enough knowledge of biology and technology and space medicine to start to prepare for an interstellar mission to actually send people on a craft that would have what's called a generation ship people live and die on the same spacecraft on the way towards a destination but i think we need that much time to actually perfect the technology and to learn enough about physiology to be able to make it for that distance and the book is kind of focused on the human story this is a specific slice of the possible futures yes there could be sort of ai systems there could be other technologies that kind of build up the world so much of the world might be lived in virtual reality so you're not touching any of that you're sticking to biology we're not you're you're touching a little bit but focused on what the cells that make up the human body how do they change how do we design technologies to repair them and how do we uh protect them and as they travel out into the cosmos absolutely and it's something that is part of the duty if your duty is to keep life safe you have to consider all means to do so and and engineering life to save itself is definitely on that list and you know i think we can imagine in that time frame 500 years that we would you know there there will be ai that's continually advancing and i actually say that i'm matter agnostic towards cognition so if your matter is carbon atoms and cells and tissues and you have cognition bravo good for you if you're if you're silicon based and you're in chips and you're an ai that's all virtual but we reached a state of you know well beyond the touring test and really clearly intelligent congratulations to you too so i feel like this sense of duty is is applicable regardless of what the state of matter your cognition is based in so i would imagine that ai platforms that are really intelligent might also get a sense of this duty or i hope they would i wrote the book for them too they can carry that flame of whatever makes humans special so but why nevertheless is so much of your focus on this human meat vehicle do you think is it it's essential it doesn't have to be me no it definitely does not it could be i'm hoping that the ai platforms that we've built or that would become that would start to build themselves would also carry the sense of duty because at that point they would be life and so whichever means that life whatever form life takes it should have this duty i think will it have the lessons of genetics genomics dna and rna and proteins and the squishy stuff that makes us uh human are those lessons a temporary thing that will discard or will those lessons be carried forward i mean like if the machines completely take over let's say and it's all uh not necessarily completely take over but either completely take over or merge with humans in some interesting way where we as opposed to figuring out how to repair cells and protect cells we start having some cyborg cells we could i think we will they'll definitely be a blending and blending's already happened there's prosthetic limbs there's cybernetic limbs there's you know uh neural link you know progress being made to blend biology and cybernetics and machines for sure but i think the you know in the long term you know we'll see that they are are fairly the biology be useful because it's it's a it's a it's a manufacturing system all of life is a way to create copies of things or to replicate information including storage of information actually hard drives are probably one of the worst ways for long-term storage dna might end up being the best way to have you know millennia or you know even longest scale storage where you want something that has redundancy that's built in and it can store and can be put at really cool temperatures and survive in cosmic rays or so i think it dna might be the best hard drive of the future potentially this is really interesting okay what is dna what is rna and what are genes yes we should because most i presume the audience knows it but some might just be first-time listeners kind of there's a person right now who's like in in brazil smoking a joint sitting on the beach and just wants to learn about dna so please please dna the dxe ribonucleic acid is the recipe for life it is what carries the instructions in almost all of your cells you have a copy of your genome it's actually the reason i became a geneticist is because the day i learned that as an embryo we started just a single cell but all the instructions there to make every single type of cell in your body i was and still am endlessly fascinated by that that is extraordinary that is to me the most beautiful thing in the entire universe that is a completely from one single embryo everything is there to make the entire body which aspect of that is most beautiful so is it that there's this information within dna that's stored efficiently and it also stores information on how to build not just what to build yeah and so from all of that is what's what's the sexiest what's the most beautiful aspect is it the entire machinery or is it just the information is there it's the fact that the machinery is the information like that they basically it becomes its own manufacturer is is what is extraordinary imagine if you if you took a one two by four and you threw it on the ground and you said i'll be back in a day and then a whole house was made when you came back i mean we would all lose our minds a lot of people would poop their pants people would have to wear adult diapers it would be a big scene yes if that happened um and then we're not we're actually getting close to that people having autonomous house building it's not quite there yet but there are people trying to make uh robots that will build entire houses but you need much more than the block of wood right right that's that's the extraordinary thing is just one one piece of wood there and say i'll just leave it there for a few days and i'll come back that's basically what embryos do okay it takes nine months a little bit longer but still that is nothing short of magic right so i think that's what i love about you know the fact that dna carries that information now the information is static so to actually read that information and to actually put into motion is where rna comes in so this ribonucleic acid so it just has one other oxygen added to it versus dna but it is the transcribed version it's like if you look at a book and you say you can have it in your hands but then you start to read it aloud it becomes the active form of the recipe for life is the rna and those rnas also then get translated to become proteins that become active forms like enzymes you think of like your hair or think of other ways you digest food there's all these you know active proteins going around that are copying your dna making rna making sure your dna is safe there's all these built-in systems to keep your cells in check and working and these are often in protein form and so genes are the really these constructs basically what are the instruction sets like how many versions of instructions do you have in your genome so the genome is the collection of all the dna of a person for humans about three billion letters of genetic code so just three billion acs g's and t's these nucleotides that are the recipe for life and that's it that is the entire instruction set to go from that one embryo up to a full human which is pretty efficient if you say it's that's actually not that that much information and in that three billion letters are snippets of the genes which are independently regulated autonomous instruction sets if you will these really active forms of of the instructions from your dna to say make a protein make this rna or turn off some other part of a cell all those instructions are there in our dna and there's about 60 000 of these genes that are in our genome so how do those all lead up to you having a personality good memory and bad memory some of the functional characteristics that we at the human level are able to interpret the the the way your face look the way you smile you're good at running or jumping whether you're good at math and all those kinds of things there's the age-old debate of nature versus nurture so like most things if given two options you can of course have both so almost every trait that we know of in humanity has mixtures of nurture and nature some of them are purely nurture so there's most people probably familiar with twin studies but twin cities are one of the best ways to gauge how much is something nurture versus nature how much of it is really ingrained and has probably less ability to change versus how much can you really train so height for example is one of the most uh obvious inheritable traits but it doesn't have one gene it probably has at least 50 or 60 genes that contribute to height so it's not like a gene for height some people think of like the gene for cystic fibrosis now that's in that case that's true there is one gene that if you have mutations you get cystic fibrosis as a disease but for other other traits they're much more complicated they can have dozens or even hundreds of genes that influence your risk and what appears but from twin studies you take monozygotic twins twins that are identical and you can clearly tell they look they have the same facial structure similar intonation similar even likes and you compare them to dizygotic twins or when you have fraternal twins you can have a male and female for example in the same uterus and those are you know dizygotic twins are two zygotes so in that case they're they share 50 of their dna but they shared the same womb and that and then what you can look at is they you know what's the difference between identical twins versus uh fraternal twins and calculate that difference for any trait and that gives you an estimate of the heritability or what's called h squared so that's what we've been doing for almost every trait in humanity for the past you know 100 years i've been trying to measure this and religion is one that's a negative control so if you separate people and see what religion they become there's no gene for religion or what religion you choose so that often is their correlation there is zero because it should be it's a nurture trait of what religion you end up taking is not encoded in your dna religion meaning islam judaism christianity but there could be aspects of religions there is a good good question there is religiosity as a trait yes there's been study influences and that has a heritable component to some degree so and things like boredom susceptibility is a trait one of my favorite papers just looked at how likely is it that people get bored and the identical twins and fraternal twins and there's a heritability about 30 so it's not it's mostly not heritable it's like mostly environmental but that means to some degree whether or not you're bored you can say well it's a little bit of my genes you could a little bit not a lot but you know most of some degree and they're probably overlapping with other traits yeah boredom susceptibility versus risk seeking behavior are interrelated so how likely are you to say i want to go you know cliff jumping or i want to go i'm going to do freebasing or i want to i don't know do some else it's risky behavior so speaking of twin studies scott kelly spent 340 consecutive days out in space you analyzed as molecular data dna rna proteins small molecules what did you learn about the effect of space on the human body from scott we learned that spaces is rough on the human body but that the human body is um amazingly and monstrously responsive to adapt to that that challenge it can rise to the occasion so we could see there scott had as almost all astronauts do a bit of puffiness and spikes in his bloodstream of these are called cytokines or these inflammation markers or the body is clearly saying to itself holy crap i'm in space and leaders of fluid move to the upper torso and they get puffy face what's called the in the astronaut uh face that is very common but it goes away after a few days and some astronauts maintain high levels of stress for their whole mission as measured by cortisol or some of these other inflammation markers whereas scott actually had a little spike but then he was cool as a cucumber for most of the mission but he had spent at that time that was the longest ever mission for a u.s astronaut a few cosmonauts have gone a little bit longer but there had never been a deep molecular analysis of what happens the body after about a year in space so it was the first study of this kind and what we found is when he got back you know we saw all the same markers of stress on the body and changes spiked up to levels we've never seen for any other astronaut before so it seemed like going to space for a year wasn't so hard as much as returning to gravity after a year it was much harder on the body he notoriously had you know broken a rash all over his body and really even the weight of clothing on his skin was too heavy it created all this irritation because his body had not felt the weight of just a simple t-shirt it was it wasn't really had zero weight of course right so and up in space so that led to all this inflammation all these changes he had to you know it was much more comfortable just to walk around nude in that case it was for a medical reason some people do this you know recreationally he was doing it for medical purposes i do it for medical i mean as well all the time i mean people say a prescription since the doctor told me so he was allergic to earth yeah very fascinating to think about actually how quick did his body adapt there so there was about three to four days he got back to normal at least in terms of the inflammation but what's extraordinary is that we've measured a lot of other molecules genes structural changes tissue look at his eyeballs look at his vasculature it took him even six months after the mission a lot of the genes that had become activated in response to space flight were still active so things like we could see his body repairing dna he was being irradiated by cosmic rays and by the radiation it's the equivalent of giving like three or four chest x-rays every day just in space and we could see his body working hard at the molecular level to repair itself and even in his urine we could see bits of what's called eight-oxley guanosine there's a form of damaged dna that you could see coming out and we see it for other astronauts as well so it's very common you can see damaged dna the response of the body to repair the dna but even though he'd been back on earth for six months that was still happening uh even six months later wait how do you explain that so some of this has to do with when you have a gene get activated you might think oh it's like a light switch i'll look at my wall just flip a light on or off and sometimes turning a gene on or off is that simple sometimes you just flip it on because the gene is already ready to go other cases though you have to reprogram even the structure of how your dna is packaged yeah which is called an epigenetic rearrangement in that case we could see in is that a lot of these genes had been in these his cells had changed the structure of how dna was packaged and it remained open even months after the mission now after about a year it was actually almost all back to normal 99 of all the genes were back to where they were in pre-flight levels so it means that you know eventually you'll adapt but there there's almost a a lag time kind of like jet lag for the body but jet lag for your cells to repair all the dna what was the most surprising the thing that you found in that study there are several surprises one is just that he that the rep as i just mentioned that the repair took so long i thought maybe a week or a few days he'll be back to normal but to see this molecular echo in his cells of his time in space still occurring was interesting this telomeres was one was really surprising the the caps and the ends of your chromosomes which keep all your dna packaged and you get half your chromosomes from your mother and half from your father and then you go on and make all your cells normally these shrink as you get older and telomeres length is just an overall sign of aging getting shorter his telomeres got longer in space and so this is really surprising because we thought the opposite would happen so he that was genetically once surprised and also some of the mutations we found in his blood he had less mutations as if his body was almost being like a low dose of radiation was sort of cleansing his body of maybe the cells that were about to die is one of our main theories on what's happening and of course you can't really you have theories but you can't because the number of subjects in the study is small right it's the it's notoriously one of the lowest powered studies in human history yes but but but what you will you lack in subjects you can make up for in the number of sampling times so we did basically 260 samples collected over the course of three years so we really almost every few weeks had a full workup uh including in space so that was the way we tried to make up for it but but we've tried another model organisms in mice we've seen this we've looked now at 59 other astronauts and in every astronaut that we've looked at their telomeres get longer in space does that indicate anything about lifespan all those kinds of things or no you can't make any of those kinds of jobs yes i won't make that jump yet but it does indicate that there is a version of cleansing if you will that's happening in space a mixture of we see this actually clinically at our hospital you can do a low dose of radiation with some targeted therapies to kind of activate your immune cells is even even tried clinically so this idea of just a little bit of stress on the body or what's called hormesis might prime you into active of cleansing things that were about to die and that includes stress uh caused by space yes yeah apparently so how do we adapt the human body to stress of this kind for periods of multiple years what what lessons do you draw from that study and other experiments in space that gives you an indication of how we can survive for multiple years i think we know that the radiation is is one of the biggest risk factors and this has been well described by nasa and many other astronauts and researchers and so there we don't have to just measure the radiation or just look at dna being damaged we can actually actively repair it this happens naturally in all of our cells there's a little enzymes little protein really many machines that go around and scan dna for nicks and breaks and repair it we could improve them we could add more of them or you can even activate them before you go into space so we have a one set of cells in my lab where you but you activate them before we irradiate them to actually prepare them for the dose of radiation and now that is what's called epigenetic crispr therapies where you can actually instead of adding or taking away a gene or modifying a cell you just change kind of how it's packaged like i was just describing the dna the genes are still there we're just changing how they get used and so you can actually preemptively activate dna repair genes and we've done this for cells we haven't done this yet for astronauts but we've done it for cells and a similar idea to this is being used to treat sickle cell disease and beta thalassemias you actually you can reactivate a gene that was dormant in his way as a therapy so should we make human genes resilient to harsh conditions or should we get good at repairing them i want to i want to get good at right okay start to interrupt i think every time i ask this question they have taught me that there's always a third option both i will say both i know uh you know for for copy it's good to just have one big statement but uh but you want to do both a good or a third option i would want to you know do electromagnetic shielding i would want to do a fourth option of you know maybe some other uh kind of physical defenses outside of the human body yeah so we're taking the same passion to keep astronauts safe that's outside them and just putting it in their cells is what i propose now it's a bit radical today because uh you know we're just starting this in clinical trials to treat you know diseases on earth so it's not ready i think to do an astronauts but in the book i proposed by about the year 2040 that's when we'd reach this next phase where i think we'll have known enough about the clinical response we'll have the technology ironed out that's about when it's time i think to try it so what are the some interesting early milestones so you said uh 2040 what do we have to look forward to in the next 10 20 years according to your book according to your thoughts a lot of really exciting developments where if you really want to activate genes like i was just describing or or repair a specific disease gene you can actually crispr it out modify it this has been already published and well documented but as alluding to more and more we'll see people that you just want to temporarily change your genes functions and change their activity so the best example this is for beta thalassemia we all have hemoglobin in our blood that carries oxygen around and we are an adult it's a different version it's a different gene you have one gene when you're a fetus called fetus fetal hemoglobin when you're adult you have a different gene but they both are making a protein that carries oxygen when you after you're born the fetal hemoglobin gene gets just turned off just it goes away and you replace it with adult hemoglobin but if your gene for hemoglobin is bad as an adult that's one of the therapies well let's turn back on the gene that you had when you were a fetus and it's actually already led to cures for sickle cell and beta thalassaemia in this past year so it's this extraordinary idea of like well you already have some of the genetic solutions in your body why don't we just reactivate them and see if you can live and indeed you can so i think we'll see more of that that's for severe disease but eventually you could see it for more uh i think work-related purposes like if you're working in a dangerous mind or a radio a high radiation environment you could you could basically start to prime it for you know work safety basically we need to genetically protect you now it would have to be shown that that genetic option is safe reliable uh you know that it's better that at least as good or if not better than other shielding methods but i think we'll start to see that more in the next 10 20 years and eventually as i describe in the book you could get to recreational genetics you could say well i want to turn some genes on just for this weekend because i'm going to a high altitude so i'd like to prepare for that and so instead of having to take weeks and weeks for acclimation you could just do some quick epigenetic therapies and have a good time in the mountains and then come back and turn them back off so this is stuff to do on earth yeah across thousands of humans and then you start getting good data about what the effects in the human body are how do we make humans survive across the entire lifetime for well let's say several decades in space if it's just in space it'll be hard because you'll you'll need basically some gravity at some point i think you'd need orbital platforms that give you at least some partial gravity if not 1g if you're on mars it's actually you know even though the gravity is 38 of earth's just having that gravity would be enough and if you could get under the surface into some of the lava tubes where you have some protection above you from the radiation i think that would be you probably could survive quite well there so i think it's the just in space part that's hard you need some gravity you need some additional protection from the radiation can you uh linger on the lava tubes on mars what are the lava tubes yes so they are a bit like what they sound like there were large masses of lava at one point on the planet pushing really quickly through the environment and they created these these basically these small caverns which you could go in theory and build a small habitat and then puff it up kind of like blowing up a balloon and have a protective habitat basically it's a little bit underground so one of the next helicopter missions being planned at the jet propulsion lab is to see if you can get a helicopter to go into the lava tube and which is just like as it sounds kind of like take out a big worm that has burrowed into the landscape and leave out the hollow column that's left and that's what your tubes look like so one of the future helicopters might even go explore one of them is a mission being planned right now so they're accessible without a significant amount of drilling yeah that's the other advantage yeah you can get to them uh because some of them are exposed you can do a little bit of drilling and then see essentially this entire thing texts you a little bit from the radiation right because you have some soil above you basically which would be a regalith which would be nice what about source of food uh what's a good so that's part of biology how you power this whole thing what about source of food across decades in space we'd have space plants have been grown in flight and you can get some nutrients but right now it is very reliant on all the up mass being sent up all the you know freeze-dried fruit that thing gets rehydrated which doesn't taste awful but is is not uh is not self-reliant right so i think those would have to be small bioreactors that have to be a lot of it work on fermentation a lot of work on you know potentially prototrophic organisms the organisms that can make all of the 20 amino acids that you would need to eat i described a little bit in the book what if we did a prototrophic human where you could have like right now we need to we need to get some of our amino acids because we can't make them all which i think is kind of sad so what if we could make all of our own amino acids or all of our own vitamins i also you know i think that's one case where another adaptation could be to activate the vitamin c gene like right right now you'd have to have limes or some other source of vitamin c in space but we actually carry the gene inside of our genome to make vitamin c look at dogs and cats for example they have these kind of wet noses you don't see them going out and getting margaritas dogs can drink beer and get drunk they don't need vitamin c they have no risk of scurvy because they can make the vitamin c all by themselves so can other wet-nosed primates called strep-serines but we are dry nose primates and we we lost this ability sometimes 10 or 20 million years ago we no longer make our own vitamin c but the gene for it is called gullo is still in our dna it's what's called a pseudogene it's just broken down it's like having a like in our genome we have these functional genes like nice bmw a nice car that works well but we also have this like wrecking this like junkyard of cold cars old genes old functions in our dna that we could bring back and so vitamin c is one of them that would be very easy to do so then you could activate the gene repair it basically repair it so we can make our own vitamin c now we'd have to do it again carefully because what if what if we lost vitamin c the production of vitamin c as a species what if it was a good reason that we lost it maybe it was helping in some other way that we can't see now but you'd start slowly do it in cells then do it you know potentially in animal models and prime other primates and then try it in humans but that's something else i'd like to see so we wouldn't have to make as much food in orbit you could actually start to make as much of your own food in your own cells so the input to the system in terms of energy could be much more restricted it doesn't have to have the diversity we currently need as humans but i don't want to be a robot humans love i i as i do texture i admit i realized that made me sound like i wasn't human but humans uh love food and flavors and textures and smells all that all of that is actually attenuated in flight so it's you'd want to not forget our humanity and so this this you know love of of all the benefits and wonder of food and cooking and smells well speak for yourself because for me i eat the same thing every single day and i um i find beauty in everything and some beauty is more easily accessible outside of earth and food is not one of those things i think what about insects people bring that up basically food that has sex with itself and multiplies so cockroaches and so on they're a source of a lot of um protein and a lot of the amino acids and bed bugs there's a guy at the american museum in natural history in new york he loves bed bugs lou sorkin and he has a monthly meeting where he talks about how which insects would be the best for eating and one one month he gave a whole talk about bed bugs that they're pretty gross but in terms of the value of what you can get for protein they're really good so they're they're a good candidate i think you'd have if you could deep fry them if you deep fry anything you can pretty much eat it so maybe you need a fryer up in space but now they're a candidate all right what uh technical question what are the major challenges of sex in space asking for a friend for reproduction purposes so like uh when we're looking about survival the human species across generations yeah do we need gravity essentially for sex and space we we know that gestation can happen in space where the babies can develop at least in mice we know that it's possible for worms to replicate and fly so it's possible to for other invertebrates to show they can make babies in space but for humans nasa's official stance on this is that there has never been sex in space yeah officially i i think you know if we all wonder about that i think humans are very predictable in that regard again going back to the greek tragedies i think that there's probably someone did something close to it at some point and so i think we we know that sperm can be sent into space and brought back and be used for fertilization for uh in vitro fertilization for humans but sex itself in space uh you know would be i think when we start to get bigger structures that have a bit more privacy i think they'll i think there'll be a lot of it and it has to be you know this this is a big question of who goes up into space it's now becoming more of you know regular in quotes people who have prosthetic limbs or cancer survivors like haley arsenau who just went up on the inspiration for mission so she's been a great uh researcher in helping with a lot of the science from that mission we have doing the same analysis on them as we've been doing for the twin study and for other astronauts we're doing basically all the same molecular profile before during an after space flight so there we now know that you know other people can go into space those more and more regular joes and jane's go up i think we'll see a lot more of it but so far we'd have no data we have no video of it either way we have no real knowledge other than it would be it would need a lot of velcro i think is my only real answer there well i i'm as a fan of velcro and duct tape i think that's going to be yes those two are essential for anything any kind of engineering out in anywhere honestly in all kinds of harsh conditions but um that is i mean on the topic of sex in general just social interaction with humans it's fascinating the the current missions are very focused on science and very technical engineering things but there's still a human element absolutely that seeps in and the more we travel out the space the more the humans the natural human drama the love the hate that merges it's all going to be right there it's a greek tragedy just in space basically i think it's going to be a reality show so what about the colonization of other planets if you look at mars when you first of all do you think it's a worthy effort looking at this particular one planet to put humans on mars and to start thinking about colonizing mars it's one of the closest options it's not the best option though by far we we uh i put in the book measures of earth similarity index or something called esis how close is the gravity the temperature the solar incidence on the surface how close is it to earth is a calculation many astronomers make when they look for exoplanets and mars is pretty far away from an esi of about 0.7 and earth is one so the best you can get is one earth is just like earth it gets a score of one anything above you know some of the best exoplanets that are in the habitable zone where there's liquid water that could be there start to get above 0.8 or 0.9 but they're most planets are very low they're 0.1.2 they're either way too big and we have crushing gravity or way too small too close to a sun but mars is even though it's not that great on the esi scale it is still very relatively close you know galactically and and venus is just too hot right now so i think venus would also be a great candidate but it is it's much easier to survive in a place where it's very cold but you can be sealed and survive whereas going on we probably just have no technology to survive anywhere except in the clouds of venus so it's just currently our best option but it's not the best option for sure so over time the esi changes across millennia and it does so the venus is going to get cooler and cooler um okay but what are the big challenges to you in colonizing mars from a biology perspective from a human perspective from an engineering perspective there's several big challenges to mars and even the first one is even just the word colonized so i think we there's even a social challenge like a lot of people danielle wood actually studies this at mit is sh we shouldn't even use the word colonized but then we probably shouldn't use the word settle either because there's settlements that have some other baggage to that word as well and then maybe we just use the word explore but at some point you didn't say we're going there to survive there and so colonization still is the word most people use but i try to say go explore and build or settle but i think the first challenge is social i think getting people to think that this will not be like the colonization efforts of the past the hope is that this will be a very different version of humanity exploring that's my hope history has you could say has proved me wrong every single time like every time humans have gone somewhere it's usually been a tale of exploitation strife and and drama again and then and and often murder genocide like it's actually a pretty dark history if you think of just all the colonization efforts but i think most of it was done in a really dark area of humanity where their average life expectancy was more than half less than it was today it was uh life was uh british and short as many of as hobbs famously said so it was it was a rough existence right so i think some of the the the ugliness of humanity in prior colonization times was was a consequence at the time and at least that's my hope i think that now we would have it be much more i think uh inclusive much more responsible much more much less you know evil frankly like we'd go there and you would need commercialization you need efforts to do mining for example bring things back but it'd have to be some degree where there are some areas that are viewed as as as commons or that are untouchable like places that are parks we do this today even if there's a lake for example the first you know several hundred feet of a lake are all for public property and everything you can own property but just not certain barriers so i think we'd have to make sure we do that so that it's not completely exploited but the so that's on the social the human side the technological we've talked a little bit about where you'd have to live you want to be underground with engineering and modifying even human cells to make sure you survive uh the soil does have a lot of perchlorates which is a problem for growing them but there's ways to extract them there's a fair amount of water there's actually a beautiful image of all the known water on mars that nasa posted about a year ago and there's water everywhere not not lots of it everywhere but you almost everywhere you look there's at least a little bit of water just a few feet under the surface and by the caps there's a lot so i think we could get some water and we could also do you know self-generating reactors machines that could make food start to even make beer if you go long enough down the path but the technical challenges are definitely the engineering and the manufacturing are going to be hard because you have to build the buildings basically out of the soil that's there so you have to really go there and try and build with whatever you can so that has to be perfected still but then once you're in those those buildings those structures you need to create all the biology that will feed the the populous feed them so which we don't have the technology for yet we have bits of it but i think that's going to be the biggest challenge is making mars really truly independent but that'll probably take as i say in the book several hundred years before i think we'd get there it's interesting because we're also exploring ways to motivate society to take on this challenge it's the jfk thing and then the cold war that inspired the race to space and i think as a human species we're actually trying to figure out different ideas for how to motivate everybody to work on the same project together but yet competed at the same time well that's one idea and that's worked well competition competition that's not necessarily the only idea but it's one that worked well so far so maybe the only way to truly build the colony in uh on mars or a successful sort of human civilization on mars is to get like china to get like uh competitive about it i think well and they are they've announced they want to have boots on the red planet by 2033 which is two to four years earlier than when nasa's supposed to do it so we'll see if they if they get there first but i think it's a space race 2.0 but it's not just the us and russia this time it's china it's india it's the uae it's europe esa jax has the japanese space agency and there's the u.s so now it went from just a two-person race to you know a whole field at the you know the whole field of runners if you will on the track trying to get to mars first and i think i mean i think this can be like anything if you start to have settlements and construction projects in places to visit on mars i think that the true mark of of some place being actually settled is when you you start to be able to pick you're like well i want to go to this destination not this one because they have better martian cocktails here but then this one's not as good so then this idea of innovating competing will continue to drive i think humans as it always has you write this um fascinating thing which is quote people living on mars will have developed entirely new cultures dialects products and even new religions or variations of current religions for example a martian muslim will need to pray upward toward the dusty sky i love that you've thought through the geometry of this for example a martian muslim will need to pray upward toward the dusty sky since earth and therefore mecca will sometimes be overhead or when mecca is below the martian's feet the prayer direction to allah will stay downward toward the 38 gravity floor perhaps a second mecca will be built on the new planet end quote that's another interesting question how will culture be different on mars in the early days and beyond yeah it'll be as we've seen with all of human history i think even just when people migrate and they move even the dialects change if you're just going to the south in the united states yeah oh y'all come on down out here you know just and that's not even that far away or even just people on long island versus new york city and i'll be there's a big nasally accent you know yeah and uh the people will just get or even wisconsin i'm from wisconsin i'll be able to speak nasally town welcome to wisconsin and minnesota i wonder who defines that culture because it's very likely that the early humans on mars will be very technically savvy yeah they have to be engineering challenges well actually i don't know it could be the this has to do with your extreme microbiome it's like is it going to be the extreme survivalists or is it going to be the engineers and scientists or is it going to be both because my experience the scientists they're you know they like the comfort of their the lab yes they don't well no there's some i keep contradicting myself non-stop there's some badass scientists that travel to like antarctica and all that kind of stuff so it's an evolutionary selection for humans who can stare at a screen for eight hours at a time or pipette for 12 hours at a time and not talk to anybody so it's not surprising when our scientists are a little bit awkward in social situations but we can we can get we can train them out of that we can get them to engage other humans uh not all of them but uh hopefully most of them so i think you know i think the culture will definitely be different there'll be different dialects different foods there'll be different values so very likely would be a different religion kim stanley robinson wrote a lot about this in his books the new martian religion that was created so i think this idea has been discussed in the in science fiction and it is almost unavoidable because there's been i mean just just think of all the religions that have happened on earth um with with you know very little i think uh dr dr i mean there's just terrestrial drama but suddenly you have a different planet and you then need a deity that would span multiple planets and i don't even know how you do that but i think someone will think of a way and make up something yeah that's uh look for ways to draw meaning so religion for a lot of people myths common ideas are a source of meaning and when you're on another planet boy does the sense of what is meaningful change because you're it's humbling the harshness of the conditions is humbling the the very practical fact that earth from which you came is not so special because you're clearly not on earth currently and you're doing fine and you made it at some point i mean it'll be pretty harsh like like what shackleton did doing this explore exploration of antarctica and going it was very dangerous mission barely made it people died actually he didn't believe in scurvy at the time so he didn't take enough vitamin c and some of his people died from not having vitamin c so if we had had their genes active the pseudo gene they'd be okay but there i think the early starter lawyers will be it'll be very different crew but once it's comfort once people are comfortable there i think they're gonna i hope they'll draw more meaning because more planets should be more meaning i feel like it's like uh more hands is a better massage i don't know if that's the best analogy here but i think aristotle said that yeah i should mention that your book has incredible quotes it's great writing but also just incredible quotes at the beginning of chapters they're really thanks it's basically my favorite quotes i'm like well i'm writing a book i'm going to put my favorite quotes as well put them all down what are your thoughts about um the efforts of elon musk and spacex and pushing this commercial space flight and i mean other companies axiom space as well uh what are your thoughts on um on their efforts it's like a gold rush uh it's a space race 2.0 there's a lot of terms for it the new space race i think it's fabulous i think it is it's moving at a pace that is unprecedented and also has a lot of investment from the commercial and private sector pushing it forward so elon most notoriously doing a lot of it just himself with spacex so we've worked really closely with the spacex ops teams and medical team uh planning the inspiration for mission and now some of the polaris missions which are happening and jared isaacman has been a fabulous colleague collaborator pilot for the missions you know we're doing again we're doing the same deep profiling and molecular characterization of these astronauts as we've done for scott kelly and other astronauts they're from nasa and we're seeing so far actually there'll be a lot of this presented later this year it seems like it's pretty safe again there's dangers we can see real stress on the body very obvious changes some of the same changes that scott kelly experienced but for the most part they returned back to normal even for a short three-day mission i remember chatting with with jared and we were presenting the data to them actually just a few weeks ago kind of a briefing to the crew and because they went to 590 kilometers they went basically several hundred kilometers higher than the space station or the hubble you normally wrestle more radiation the farther you get from earth there's more radiation he was worried you know did we get cooked it was kind of his question for me in the briefing it actually looks like you can go back into the microwave you didn't get fully cooked you can go a little bit farther so for the polaris mission they're going to go even farther uh and then also open the hatch and go on these new spacesuits that spacex is designing that'll be much nimbler not as much of a giant you know dr octagon kind of uh spacesuit but really like looks like just a nice spacesuit they're gonna go out into the vacuum of space and so you know pushing all the engineering uh for these missions which are privately funded so it's it's people who just say i want to go up in space and see if i can push the limits has been fabulous but i think the most fabulous part is is jared in particular but others other commercials space flight drivers like john schaffner peggy whitson for the axiom missions are coming to us the scientists researchers saying i don't just want to go up into space just to hang out how much science can i get done when i'm up there what can i do what experiments can i do give me you know blood tissue urine semen tears i'll give you any biofluid uh you know and i always i email them back and say listen every one of your cells is worthy of study i said send me you know so i have this really kind of creepy geneticist email responsible like i want all of your cells you know but but it's true because there's so much we don't know i want to learn as much as we can about every every time i go up anyone so we're doing it you know with nasa astronauts but it's been suddenly this influx of new crews that are willing to do almost anything right so including we did skin biopsies for the inspiration for crew before and after space flight and that's never been done before we've never seen the structure of the skin and how it changes in response to microgravity and also the microbes that change and so these beautiful images of even the structure of skin changing and the inflammation that we've seen in like for scott kelly for example we now have a molecule by molecule map of what happens to skin which has never been done before so there what are interesting surprises there so one of the things we can see the part what's driving inflammation is we can actually see macrophages there's other dendritic cells pieces like cells that are part of the immune system kind of creeping along towards the surface of the skin which is now we know it's actually physically driving the immune system is these cells going and creating this inflammation which is what leads to some of the rashes but we didn't see as much in them as we saw for example some of the signatures of scott kelly so we can see within the crew who's getting more of a rash or not or who didn't experience any rash and some people had changes in vision some people had you know other uh gi problems uh even you know even looking at what happens to the gut and looking at the microbiome they got other people didn't so we able to see and start to get a little bit predictive about our medicine right now we're just diagnosing but it'd be good to say uh if you're going into space here's exactly what you need for each bacteria in your body here's what you can really take to get rid of nausea or other ways we can monitor you to keep keep the inflammation down what does it take to prepare for one of these missions because you mentioned some of the folks are not necessarily lifelong astronauts you're talking about more and more regular civilians what's what does it take physiologically and psychologically to prepare for these they have to do a lot of the same training that most astronauts do so a lot of the time hawthorne at spacex headquarters which if you can ever get a chance to do a tour it's fabulous it's really you can see all these giant rockets being built and then we're drawing blood over there right next to them so it's a really cool place but the the training they have to go through a lot of the ops a lot of the programming just in case most of the systems are automated on the dragon and other spacecraft but just in case so they have to go through all the majority of the training if you want to go to the space station as the axiom missions are including john schuffner you have to do training for some of the russian modules and if you don't do that training then you're not allowed to go to that russian part of the space station apparently so right now john schaffner for example unless he completes this additional training all in russian he's not allowed all in russia i still learn enough russian to be you know just wow so it's not just technical he also has enough enough russian enough enough russian and uh so it's a and if he doesn't learn he can't go to that part of the space station so interesting things like that are but you'll be you know it's not that far you're like oh i can see it right there i can't float over to that that capsule uh but technically he can't go so you know is there uh a chinese components to this the international space station is there collaboration there sadly not they're building uh their own space station uh i'm glad they're building a space station actually eventually there'll be probably four space stations in orbit by 2028 some from the orbital reef some from lockheed martin of course axiom is far ahead right now they're probably going to be done first but the the extraordinary thing is uh the there's unfortunately there's no collaboration between the you see that as a negative that's not the positive kind of competition it's it's a good question so maybe as for example when we get different nasa grants you apply for a grant you get to the lab it goes you know to go through cornell the grants office i have to sign as a scientist as the pi on the mission say i promise i will move no funds or resources or any staff to anyone in china or work with anyone in china with these dollars that you're giving to the lab for this mission and so every other grant i get from the nasa dod or sorry do you let me go back to that okay every other grant i get from say the nih or the nsf even symptoms dod you don't have to promise that you won't talk to anybody in china about it but for nasa alone it's congressionally mandated you have to promise and sign all this paperwork so i can't do anything with anyone in china about this and what i view is sad about that is i want to at least be able to chat with them about it and know what they're up to but we can't you know even go to a conference in china technically with nasa funds about say space medicine or engineering a new rocket i i can't go i could go with personal funds but i can't use those funds like you should be able to go to a conference and in a friendly way talk yeah yeah just yeah we're doing like like the way scientists do really well which is like they complement but it's a backhanded compliment like uh like you're doing a really good job here and then you kind of imply that you're doing much better job that's the core of competition you get jealous and then everybody's trying to improve but that you're ultimately talking you're ultimately collaborating closely you're competing closely as opposed to in your own silos well let me ask uh in terms of preparing um for space flight you know i i tweeted about this and i joked about it and i i talked to you along quite a lot these days what i tweeted was i'd like to do a podcast in space one day and uh it was a silly thing uh because i was thinking for some reason in my mind i was thinking 10 20 years from now and then i realized like wait why not like now yeah there's no just even seeing what uh axiom is doing what inspiration four is doing it's like regular civilians could just start going up well so let me ask you this question when do you think we saw jeff bezos go on to orbit what do you think elon goes up to space so his thinking about this is it's partially responsible until it's safe because he has such a direct engineering roles in the running of multiple companies so at which point do you think what's your prediction for the year that elon will go up i think you probably go up by 2026 i would say because the number of missions planned there'll be pr several missions per year through multiple space agencies and companies that are really making low-earth orbit very routine and by go up i think it might also for example the inspiration for mission just went up for three days in flight you know it was enough time to get up there do some experiments enjoy the view and then you came back the axiom emissions are a bit more complicated there's docking up in the space station it's a shared atmosphere so you have to follow all the iss protocols what's what's interesting about the dragon capsule and the inspiration for and some of these what are called free flyer missions you can just launch into space you basically have your own little mini space station for a few days it's not that big right but i think that's what we'd probably see him do first because they're fair you know we're going to see a lot more tests of those in the next three to three years but they're already been demonstrated to be safe and then you're not trying to go for 10 to 20 days or months or years at a time it's just up in space for a few days but you're in proper space it's an orbital flight it's not just a subway flight you're um you could do the podcast from there and i think 2026 i wonder how the audio works see also can you comment on 2026 i'll i'll start getting ready i'll start pushing him on this i'm quite quite serious it's a fascinating kind of axiom two still has room you could go on that mission if you want consistency so i'll ask you about axiom um what how strict are these so this this seems surreal that civilians are traveling up so how many how much bureaucracies there's still in your experience for the scientific i mean i know it's a difficult question to ask a scientist because you get to you know you don't want to complain too much but how much you know there's sometimes bureaucracy with nsf and the od and the funding and all those kinds of things um that kind of prevent you from being as free as you might sometimes like to to do all kinds of wild experiments and crazy experiments now the benefit of that is that you don't do any wild and crazy experiments that hurt people right right and so it's very important to put safety first but it's like a dance a little too much restrictions the bureaucracy can hamper the flourishing of science a little too little of that can get some crazy scientists to start doing unethical experiments okay that said nasa and just space flight in general is sort of famously very uh very uh risk-averse so what's your sense currently about like even like doing a podcast right podcast you know unless it's a you know i think with uh mixed martial arts is a pretty safe activity unless you're doing uh the octagon version of your podcast i mean just getting there and back is the only real risky part which is still risky right but i think you're not asking me to do you know open heart surgery in space you're just saying what if i do a podcast and i think well fun you're trying to ask to have fun yes and i feel like fun sounds dangerous any kind of fun ah that's what's been extraordinary is that traditionally yes i think most the space agencies have been very by definition bureaucratic because they're coming from the government and but they've been been that way for a really good reason is that safety you know in the early 60s we know almost nothing about the body in space except for you know some of the work that pilots had done at really high altitudes so we really didn't know what at all to expect so it's good that there were decades of resolute focus on just safety but now we know it's pretty safe we know this physiological response is we know what to expect we can also treat some of it but hopefully hopefully soon we'll treat a lot more of it but if you just want to go up there it's actually now it's just a question of cost like imagine i think the way you can view a lot of the commercial space flight companies is that if you have the funds you can basically plan the mission all the training they'll do is to help you get prepared for how you run some of the instrumentation how you can fly the rocket to the limited degree and how to use some of the equipment but fundamentally it's no longer a question of years and years of training and selection this impossible odds task of becoming an astronaut it's frankly just a question of funds expensive plane rides so how much how much you mention axiom well is it known how much the it costs for the plane ride there is no official number and it depends on the mission of course so the if you ask them well often they'll say well how serious are you they really want they don't just want to give out random numbers to people right uh but the numbers because for example we propose one mission we want a new twin study where someone goes up and stays up there for 500 to 550 days to basically be up there for the longest time ever to simulate the time it would take to get to mars and back for the shortest possible duration about 550 days because if you went there and immediately turned around you could maybe make that mission otherwise it's a three-year mission the and there we go you know it's you're looking at the ranges of you know it's 50 to 100 million dollars in that ballpark range but the reason it's so variable is it depends what are you doing up there if you're up there for example for two two years basically almost almost two years that's a long time just being in one spot right so could you be doing some things where you're yeah it's you can your time is valuable so you can do experiments and people pay for those and that defrays the cost or you could build something or you could do podcasts and maybe you know fundraise on the podcast and so as long as you the reason the cost is variable is because it depends well do you have all the money and you say i want to go and just sit in space for two years and do nothing well then you have to pay for all that time that you're up there if you want to do things and yeah i see the the official x1 mission was 55 million for a trip to the iss it could be worse wait i uh sergey just posted a 35 000 price tag per night per person on the iss is that real i don't know that sounds about right that's why that's like a real hotel so to stay oh so interesting um and then i'm sure there's costs with the docking and all those kinds of things that's from the perspective of axiom the private company or spacex or whoever is whoever is paying the cost and uh in the short term in the in the long term yeah and then think about a lot of that cost is rocket fuel a lot of it is the ride so it's i've been on calls where axioms like hey spacex give us make it a little cheaper we can make it cheaper and it there's the cost that that is the rocket as well so spacex is giving axiom a ride right right in this case what is axiom space can you speak to this this particular private company what's their mission what's their goal and what what is the axiom one mission that just went up yeah it's uh so the axiom space is a private space flight company that's building the the first private space station to actually i've seen the videos and footage and hardware being put together so they're in the process of constructing it the hope is that by 2024 one of the first modules will be up and connected to the iss and eventually be expanded and then by 2028 the plan is it'll be completely uh detached and free floating and it will be maybe even a little bit sooner depending on how fast it goes but they're building the world's first private space station so if you want to have a wedding up there you just have to multiply the number of guests times the number of nights and you could have a wedding up there it'd be very expensive but if you want to do it you can do it it's like it's it's you can have a lab up there if you want to do experiments you can do experiments you figure out the cost you want to have a beer up there you can make your own breeder and beer and so this is the first beer made in space for some reason you want to do it you can pay for it so it's opened up this space where if you can find the funds for it you propose it you can probably just do it okay cool uh so what is the axiom one mission that just went up can you tell me what happened axiom one is the first private uh the first commercial crew to go to the space station so inspiration four was the first commercial private crew to just go into space they went in space and actually an orbital mission for just about three days but axiom 1 is the first you know again on the spacex rockets but launched up docked to the space station and they're up there for about 10 days to do experiments to work with staff actually just take some pictures but it's a mission actually doing a lot of experiments doing almost 80 different experiments so it's live it's very science-heavy which i love as a scientist but it's the ability to show that you can fundraise and launch up a crew that's all privately funded and then go to the space station it's four people and four people and the axiom two will also likely be four people the two that have been announced are john schaffner and peggy whitson peggy woodson's uh already prior nasa astronaut has been at many times the many experiments she knows the space station like our own house and uh we recently did a training with peggy and john in my lab at cornell to get ready for some other genomics experiments that we'll do on that mission so they're doing the experiments too what does it take to design an experiment and to run a design experiment here on earth that runs up there and then also to actually do the the running of the experiment what are the constraints what are the opportunities all that kind of stuff there are the biggest is is what is it what do you need for reagents or materials the liquids that you might use for any experiment what if it floats away what if it gets in someone's eye because things always float away in space there's notoriously panels in the space station where you don't want to look behind because it's got a little fungus or food has gotten stuck there and sometimes found months and months or years later so things things float around so the little things just and and so if you have anything you need to do your experiment that's a liquid or a solid whatever that is it has to go through toxicity testing and the big question is if this thing whatever you want to use gets in someone's eye will they lose their vision or be really injured and if the answer is yes it doesn't mean the answer you can't use it just means if the answers yes you have to then go through multiple levels of containment there's a glove box on the space station where you can actually do experiments that have triple layers of containment so you can still use some harsh reagents but you have to do them in the glove box and so but you can propose almost anything the biggest challenge is the weight if it's a heavy it's ten thousand dollars per kilogram to get something up into space so if you have a big heavy object that there's some costs you have to consider and that includes the not just the materials but the the equipment used to analyze the materials one of the ones we worked on actually with kate rubins was putting the first dna sequencer in space called the biomolecular sequencer mission also with aaron burton and sarah castro wallace but there the interesting thing is we had to prepare this tiny little sequencer it sequences dna you can do it really quickly within really minutes and what's extraordinary is what you have to do if you want to get a piece of machinery up there you have to do destructive testing so you have to destroy it and see what happens how does it destroy do pieces little pieces of glass break everywhere if so that's a problem so you have to redesign it and do fire testing how does it burn how does your device explode in a fire or doesn't it you have to test that and then you do vibration testing so you have to basically if you want to fly one thing into space you need to make four of them and destroy at least three of them to know how they do how they destroy destructive destructive fire fire and then vibration testing um it's kind of like asking for a friend how how do you from a scientific perspective do destructive testing and how do you do fire testing and how do you do vibration testing vibrations like well just large shakers so that's uh this is mostly to simulate launch they have a lot of machinery at nasa and it's spacex to do just to make sure what does this completely fall apart if it has a high vibrational essentially force attached to it so it's just looking like a big shaker fire testing is just to simulate what would happen if there was a normal fire that something that gets up to you know the fire temperatures several hundred degrees celsius and does spin fire or are we talking like you put in a toaster no it's more like heat or is it over flames it's flames then heat but it's it's not like a kiln or anything like that it's not you don't want to know how does it burn in the kiln it's more is it flammable it's the first big question like does it just start on fire if it gets a little bit of flame on it does it just light up like a christmas there's a youtube video of this oh you know what you guys did you film any of this not um aaron burton might still have some of the videos uh we're in the middle of doing some testing for the new sequencer called the mark 1c so i will make videos of that i would i would love to uh see that for if anything for my private collection and this is very exciting and the destructive testing is just often it can be something as simple as as a hammer it's really how does it chatter you want to question his other glass components and stuff so it's like office space it looks like that scene with the facts damn it feels good to be a gangster soundtrack yeah that's a great scene that's so that's so exciting that kind of that's the best of engineering is like that kind of testing what else about designing experiments like what kind of stuff do you want to get in there you said 80 different experiments so we're staying in the realm of biology and genetics yeah for now but we but we also want to do you know some of the experiments have been discussed in the lab have been and some are being planned as well but i think the most controversial one that's come up in our in our planning it gets back to sex in space is you know can human embryos divide and actually begin to develop in space but then if we do that experiment that means you're taking viable human embryos watching them develop in space then you can freeze them and bring them down and characterize them to see but to answer that question because we actually don't know can a human embryo actually develop well in zero gravity we just don't know but to find that out that means we have to literally sacrifice embryos probably so and which itself has of course uh you know a lot of complications ethical considerations some people just wouldn't it's a non-starter for lots of people so but we do know that this sperm survives as earlier said yes and nobody cares about sperm we're doing several studies on uh autism risk for fathers and sperm and you know it's really easy to get sperm i'll just tell you it's uh people say you're helping us what i hear that's right so i read that somewhere asking for a friend um okay cool are you involved in axiom one axiom two experiments like what what does your lab directly or indirectly involve with in terms of experiment design what are you excited about different experiments that are happening out there some of them were doing a lot of the direct training for the crews it's really saying how do you how do you do a modern genetics experiment so for the axiom one for inspiration four and axiom one we're also collaborating with trish which is the translational research arm for nasa that's in houston and there it's a lot of sharing of samples and data for all these missions for basically for all the commercial spaceflight missions there'll be a repository where you can look at the data from the astronauts so you can look at some of the genetic information some of the molecular changes so that's being built up with trish which has been fabulous collaboration between cornell and trish but the other thing we're doing is for axiom two is training them how do you for example if you want to look at a virus you can take a swab of something extract it sequence it and say do i have omicron or do i have a different virus and we're using the exact same work in flight but we're having the astronauts do the extraction the sequencing and the analysis of all the molecules and so one of the common occurrences herpes is reactivated often in spaceflight oral herpes so you can see that viral reactivation is one of the biggest kind of mysteries in space flight where the immune system seems to be responding a lot it's active the body's really perturbed but viruses start shedding again and it's really this happens clinically again we see this for like for example hepatitis c or hepatitis b you can get infected with it and it can stain your body for decades and still kind of be hiding in the body and in this case we see it in space flight herpes comes back so we want to figure out is it there first of all and then when is it happening and characterize it better but have the astronauts do it themselves rather than collecting it and bringing it back to earth and figuring out later we could see in real time how it's happening and then also look at their blood we'll see what what is changing in their blood in real time with these these new sequencers so i'm excited about the genomics in space if you will so clearly somebody who loves robots um how many robots are up there in space that help with the experiments like what how much technology is there would you say is it is it really a manual activity or is there a lot of robots helping out good questions so far it's almost all manual because the robots have to all undergo the destructive fire and vibrational testing how so if you have a million dollars so exciting yeah so if you can get that thing is a lot less than a million so we can definitely test it out for the uh in i guess in which order no you have to do separate for each one yeah vibration fire uh no note to self do fire testing for the legged robots and the destructive testing that would be fascinating i wonder if uh any of the folks i'm working with did that kind of testing on the materials like what breaks first with the robots that's the question and also the big question so what's interesting about this for axiom and for these commercial spaceflight areas if you can fund it you could fly it right so if you have to say like i want to fly these series of robots up because i think they could help build something or they could help measure or repair the spacecraft oh you have to come up with a good reason yeah well for nasa you have to go group but i think for private space flight you could have the reason is i'm curious and that could just be exactly like i've got a private funder i've got your own money and then you pay uh per kilogram yeah essentially and i mean there are some things you can't say i want to send a nuclear bomb up there i'm curious i don't think that would fly but there's probably rules in terms of free-floating robots right they probably have to be attached they have to like it's an orchestra that plays together all the experiments that are up there there's probably it's not silos it's not separate a separate kind of things but you're saying it's all mostly manual how much electronics is there in terms of data collection in terms of all that kind of stuff a lot of electronics so a lot of its tablets there's laptops up there there are you know the whole the space station is is running and humming on electronics actually it's one of the biggest complaints astronauts have is is sleeping up there is hard not only because you're in zero gravity but there's a consistent loud hum of the space station there's so many things active and humming and and moving uh that are keeping this the station alive the co2 scrubbers all the instrumentation it's loud so i think it is a very well powered uh lab basically in in flight but it but it uh and one of the future space stations i think will be very different because they're being built more for pleasure than business or you know a little bit of both but they're built for we want people to you know at least when you talk to axiom when you talk to the other industry partners they want to make it you know space more fun and engaging and open to new ideas so that's looking at the fun stuff going on in the next few years but if we zoom out once again how and when do we get outside of the solar system you mentioned this before or maybe you can mention the other hops we might take you know what let's let's step back a little and where are some of the fun places we might visit first in a semi-permanent way inside the solar system that you think are worth visiting yeah at the end of 500 years i'm hoping we make the big launch towards another solar system really driven by the fact that we now actually have exoplanets that we know we might be able to get to and survive on whereas 20 years ago we really had almost none certainly none that we knew were habitable and exoplanets even just just discovered didn't start to happen until 89 and really the early 90s for the real validated ones so you know i'm hoping over the next 500 years we go from thousands of possible habitable plants to hundreds of thousands or millions that you know especially with some of the recent telescopes launch we'll find them but but before we get there i have a a whole section i really describe about the magic of titan because it has all this methane which is a great hydrocarbon you can use to make fuel you can use it it's cold as all bejesus on titan but if you get ice it's uh yeah it's it's what so what's a titan made up of what is titan oh everybody loves titan yeah it is it's a favorite uh it's this kind of eerie uh green hued moon um that's around saturn that is uh into our knowledge you know this large it has like you know it's so cold it has these methane lakes where the methane normally is a gas but there would actually be so cold it's like a lake of methane you could go swimming in it potentially there might be some degree of rocks or maybe mountains there but they might also be made of like frozen methane so no one's ever no person's obviously been there but it is you have enough satellite imagery and some data that you could actually potentially survive on titan so i think that'd be one place where i'm hoping that we would at least have a bit of an outpost it might not be a luxurious retreat because it's really cold is there a life on titan you think underneath the surface somewhere maybe well actually with all that carbon and all those hydrocarbons it is very possible that some microbial life could be there and hanging out waiting for us to to dip our toes into the methane and find it but we don't know yet but i think that's one place i'd like to see an outpost i would like to see other outposts near jupiter but jupiter has extremely high radiation actually so even places like io which are volcanically active and quite amazing we probably couldn't survive that long that close to jupiter though it has because it brings such a giant planet uh it emits back out a lot of radiation that it's collecting from other parts of the universe and it juts back out so if you get too close to jupiter it'd actually almost certainly not be able to survive depending on which part of it but that's one risk about jupiter um but it'd be cool to see the giant red spot uh up close maybe have some spots there a mars stop one then you get to pick titan or io so ice firing ice the robert frost poem comes to mind yeah and then europa is that you would be called to an enceladus which is a big ocean it might be there like an alien ocean that's under the uh it might be even water ice that's there and why even liquid water potentially there under the surface so that'd be a great candidate the asteroids of ceres would be good or arrows or big enough you get a little bit of gravity that they'd be interesting you could you know have maybe a habitable place there and they just might be big enough that you could get there survive and even have a tiny bit of gravity but not much why do you like asteroids no are you just this we're just listing vacations yeah vacation spots yes i'd say well so they probably have a lot of rare earth minerals that you could use for manufacturing which is why part of the space economy that's being built up now is people really wanted to go and hollow out the asteroids and bring back all the um you know all the resources from it so this uh legally is very possible because even though um the the space space act prevents people from militarizing space or owning all of it if you get the resources out of an asteroid but you don't actually say you own it that's still that's perfectly legal so you could what's the space act uh it's basically 1967 was the first a large-scale agreement between major international parties particularly the u.s and russia but also many others to say that space should be a place for humanities to not militarize it to not weaponize it to not militarize it also establish some of the basic sharing principles between countries who are going into space and there was a plan to make an additional act in the 90s the the lunar the lunar actually i'm blank on the name of what but the uh there hasn't been any significant legislation that has been universally accepted since the space act so but the primary focus was on the militarization the militarization which was in theory not allowed which will which so far has stayed true but but there's no um is there any legal framework for who owns space and space uh like different geographical regions of space both out in space and on asteroids and planets and moons the currently you can't own you're not supposed to be able to own i mean people have tried to sell bits of the moon for example or sell names of stars which is pretty harmless but you're not supposed to be able to own any part of the moon or an asteroid for that matter but you're allowed to mine the resources from it so in theory you could go catch an asteroid hollow out the whole thing like you eat an orange and leave the shell and say okay i'm done i never owned it but i just extracted everything inside of it and now i'm done with it and and then of course you see there's going to be some contentious battles even wars over those resources hopefully at a very small scale it's more like conflict or like human tension but oh boy it's like war makes for human flourishing like after the war somehow sometimes there's just this explosion of conflict and afterwards for a long while there's a flourishing and again conflict and flourishing and hopefully over a stretch of uh millennia the rate of conflict and the destructiveness of conflict decreases it has at least in the past hundred years the number of wars number of military actions casualties have all decreased i don't know if it's gonna stay that way for humanity going i think you know the trajectory is there i think the the war mongering is less tolerated by the international community the you know it's more scrutinized it still happens like you know right now is an ongoing war between russia and ukraine and you've spoken a lot about it and it's you know uh but it it's you know there there are sometimes will be small military actions but i think the the you know and even there there's a you know uh large military action across most of the country but not all of it actually right so it's i think we see less over time of large-scale multi-country invasions like like we've seen in the past i think maybe that won't happen ever again but you might see country to country battles happening which has always happened i think um but hopefully less of that as well and yet the destructiveness of our weapons increases so it's a it's it's a complicated race in both directions we become more peaceful and more destructive at the same time it's fascinating how do we get outside the solar system you uh you write an epic line i believe it's the title of one of the sections launched toward the second sun that journey of saying we're going to somehow the solar system feels like home yeah the earth is home but the solar system is home it's our sun the sun is a source of of uh life yeah and going towards the second son leaving this home behind that's that's one hell of a journey yeah so what does that journey look like when when does it happen and what's required to make it happen to get to that state we have to actually have you know i describe a number of options either we have to all have people survive and multiple generations live and die on the same spacecraft towards another another star propulsion technology you need to have that in place i assume we don't have dramatic improvements i describe ways that could happen like anti-matter drives or things that could make it possible to go faster but since it's a book of non-fiction i just make no big leaps other than what we know of today that's possible and if that's the case you'd need probably 20 generations to live and die on one spacecraft to make it towards what is our known closest habitable exoplanet now that sounds you know so you need to have the life support self-reliance self-sustainability all in that one it'd be a large spacecraft you'd have to grow your own food probably still have some areas with gravity it would be complicated but i think after 500 years we could actually have the technology and the means and the understanding of biology to enable that and and so with that as a backdrop you could have people hibernate and talk about like maybe you need to hibernate instead of just people living their normal life but i think we don't the hibernation technology doesn't work that well yet i don't know if it might pan out and maybe in 200 years it gets really good then people can all just sleep in pods great you know so i'm i i think this is the the minimum viable product with everything that we have today and nothing else right so if that's the case which of course i'm sure of more than 500 years but based on what we know today you have people live and die on the spacecraft and that sounds almost like a prison sentence you say if you were born into a spacecraft and and when you got old enough they just said we're yes you can tell we're on a spacecraft we you will live your whole life on this let's say something the size of a building and this is everyone you'll ever know and then you'll die and then your children will also carry on the mission would those people feel proud and excited to say we are the the vanguard and hope of humanity we're going towards a new son and maybe they'd love it or would they after 10 generations maybe they would rebel and say to hell with this i'm tired of being in this prison this is a bad idea we're turning around or we're going somewhere else or a mutiny happens and they kill each other right so we would have to really make sure that the mental health the structure the societies built so they could sustain that mission that's a crazy mission but it's not that much different from spaceship earth right here we are stuck on one planet we don't have planetary liberty we can't go to another planet right now we can't even really go to another moon that easily so we and we i love earth there's lots of wonderful things here but it's still just this one planet and we're stuck on it so everyone that you know and love and live with here will be dead someday and that's all you'll ever know too so i think it's a difference of scale not a difference of type in terms of an experience it's still a spaceship traveling out in space earth is still a spaceship traveling out of space so it is a kind of prison it's always everybody lives in a prison well let's say it's a limited planetary experience we'll say it's like that like yeah prison's not so dark but but just yeah just like prison is a there's a limited geographic and culinary experience but i don't want it to be viewed that way i want to think wait this is what an extraordinary gift and we wouldn't probably just launch one generation ship we'd probably launch 10 or 20 of them to different the best candidates and hopefully get there and yeah i mean the the fact is limitations and constraints make life fascinating because the human mind somehow struggles against those constraints and that's how beauty is created so there is kind of a threshold you know being stuck in one room is different than being stuck in a building uh and being stuck in a in a city being stuck in like i wonder what the threshold of people like um yeah i i lived for a long time in a studio and then i upgraded gloriously to a one-bedroom apartment and the power to be able to like close the door was magnificent right it's just like wow you can speak volumes it's like you can escape that feels like freedom that's the definition of freedom having a door where you could close it and now you're alone with your thoughts and then you can open it and you enter and now there's other humans as freedom so the the threshold of what freedom the experience of freedom is like is is really fascinating and like you said there could be technologies in terms of hibernation vr you know ultra reality virtual reality like because you know 30 years ago they sounded awful i think they think you'd be stuck in a spacecraft but now you can bring the totality of all of humans history culture every every music every bit of music song every movie every book can all be on one tablet basically right so and also you'd still get up updates from netflix if you're on the way towards another star you can still get downloads and so but eventually maybe the crew would start to make their own shows i'd be like well i don't want the earth shows i want to talk about i'm going to make a drama on this spacecraft but i think it would have to be big enough so it feels like at least the size of the building i think people's intuitions about quarantining have really become very uh immediate because we've all had to experience it to some degree in the past two years and we've survived but definitely we've learned that you need a really good internet connection you need you know some ability to go somewhere sometimes and you know that might just be as simple as people leaving the spacecraft to go to something that's another thing connected to it or just go out into the vacuum of space for an afternoon to experience it um so people need recreation people need games people need toys people love to play what are chloro humans chloro humans is a description of how you can embed chloroplasts into human skin or these the thing that makes plants green so they can absorb light from the sun and then get all their energy that way and of course humans don't do this but i described in the book in the far future maybe three four hundred years from now if we could work on the ways that animals and plants work together you could embed chloroplasts in human skin and then if you're hungry you go outside and you lay out your skin and then you absorb sunlight and then you go back in when you get full if you only wanted to lay outside for just say one hour to get get your days fully you know your day's fully value of energy you'd need about two tennis courts worth of skin that you could lay out and maybe your friends would plant or something but if they plant it then their shadows would block your sun so maybe leave your skin out there and you could roll up your skin go back inside after about one hour and that's how much skin you would need to have exposed with some reasonable assumptions about the light capture and efficiency of the chloroplast so it's just kind of a fun concept in the book of green humans going around absorbing light from the sun something i've dreamed about since i was a kid is there engineering ways of like having that much skin and being able to laying it out efficiently like is there it sounds absurd but you could roll it up it would be or you could just lay outside longer i want to think if you just need to have one hour and how much game would you need but if you just went out there for four hours you need something that's smaller but you know think of you know says of a half of a tennis court so you could make it like wings could be like and you lay them out there and but but also if you that's if you need all your energy only from your skin so if you just get a little bit of it your energy of course you could just walk around with your skin as is and you still have to eat but not as much and i described that because we'd need other ways to think about making your own energy if you're on a really long mission that's far from stars you could turn on a lamp that would give you some of that you know essentially exact wavelength of light you need for your chloroplast and your skin but it's you know that's something i'm hoping would happen in three to four hundred years but it would be hard because you're taking a plant organelle and putting it into animal cell which sounds weird but we have mitochondria inside of us which basically where our cells capture the bacteria and now it walks around with us all the time so there's precedent for an evolution how much by the way speaking of which does evolution help us here so we talked a lot about engineering you know building you know genetically modifying humans to make it more resilient or having mechanisms for repairing parts of humans um what about evolving humans or evolving organisms that live on humans sort of the thing you mentioned which you've already learned is that humans are pretty adaptable now what does that mean you also um somewhere wrote that you know there's trillions of cells that make up the human body and you know those are all organisms and they're also very adaptable so can we leverage the natural process of evolution of the slaughter the selection the mutation and the adaptation that is all in uh sorry to throw slaughter into there it's just just acknowledging that a lot of organisms have to die in evolution uh can we use that for long term space travel or colonization [Music] occupation there's is there a good word for this of uh pl of planets like it's a to terraform the planet you know to adjust the human body to the planet oh oh oh there's not really a term for that yet i guess to like adapt to uh what the new vacation spot yeah i called it just the directed evolution in the book is that you you you guide the evolution towards what you want in this case sometimes you can engineer your cells to make exactly what you want but other times you put people on planets and and see how they change actually later in the book i imagine if you have humans on multiple planets you could have this virtuous cycle whereas people adapt and evolve here you'd sequence their dna and see how they change and then send the information back to the other planet and then study them with more resources so you'd be able to then have a continual exchange of what's evolving in which way and different planets and then each planet would learn from the changes that they see at the other planet does the evolution happen at the scale of human or do we need the individual like or is it more efficient to do like bacteria bacteria cheaper and faster and easier but we but we also have a lot of bacteria in us on us and all around us and even the bacteria on the space station are continually evolving so do you study that by the way like non-human cells like what the microbiomes yep the so we've seen it for the astronauts we can actually see their their immune system respond to the microbiome of the space station so as soon as you get into that aluminum tube there's a whole ecosystem that's already up there and we can actually see we saw this with scott kelly we've seen these other astronauts you can see the t cells in their body they actually are responding to little peptides a little the the molecules of the bacteria they're the immune system is looking for specific bacteria and then once it's these new ones it remembers it and you can see the body looking for the microbes that are only on the space station that you don't see on earth and then when scott came back he actually had more of those microbes embedded in his skin and in his mouth and stool that weren't there before so he like picked up new hitchhikers in the space station and brought some of them back down with them so there's like long-term ecosystems yeah 20 years they've been up for 20 years yes there's some like chuck norris bacteria up there i'm sure uh you um you're part of the extreme microbiome project what does that involve and what kind of fun fun organisms have you all learned about have you gotten to explore we have a really fun project xmp the extreme microbiome which is as it sounds like we look for really odd places like heavy radiation environments high salt high or low temperature you know strange area the space station for example lots of radiation and microgravity places where organisms can evolve for interesting adaptations and some of them have been organisms we've seen like a candy pink lake in australia called lake hillier which would just publish a paper on this word why is it pink uh so it's actually uh denalia salinas and these one of these organisms there's a mixture of bacteria and some algae that are there that make it bright pink so they actually make carotenoids these like really sort of orangey and kind of pink molecules when you look at them in the light so if you know if you get enough of the bacteria it becomes pink so and it's not just pink it's like a bubblegum pink the lake and so we uh that's just an odd it's a halophile being said it grows in 30 salt and if you go below 10 15 percent salt it doesn't even grow it actually kills it well yeah there it is liqueur is it toxic to humans or no it so when you walk in the pink lake actually it's so hypertonic meaning it's so salty you can feel it lysing and killing your cells on your foot so it actually hurts the walking because it's so salty uh so yeah so but it won't kill it'll listen you have to suffer for art and that's great art requires something i mean so it is a beautiful lake uh you have to get permits to go sample there but we actually just got an email last week there's pilots who fly over this in australia because they love the color yeah so he emailed us one of the pilots and he said hey guys i saw you publish his paper it's not as pink as it used to be because he loves flying over it it was like a little bit less pink because i had a bunch of rain in the past few weeks so it was just a little bit diluted so we reassured him it'll get more pink as they grow again uh but basically yeah it's a beautiful pink lake and so that is gorgeous it's almost like that it's like a dr seuss book or something it does it's like it doesn't even look hard to get to yeah it's there's no road if you have to basically fly uh land nearby and then paddle in but uh so it's not next to anything so it's hard to get to but once you get there um it's beautiful if anyone knows how to get there let me know i want to go there okay cool what are some other extreme organisms that you study other ones uh there's some organisms we studied in the space station called acinitobacter pitii which is a often found in human skin but we found hundreds of strains in the space jason that we've brought down and curated and then sequenced uh and this is with uh katsuri venkatsuran who's at jet propulsion laboratory working with him and they have evolved so they're now they no longer look like any earth-based ascinitobacter they don't look like they've now basically a new species so actually we uh there's there's a different species of bacteria and fungi that have now mutated so much on the space station they're literally a new species and so we've found some of those that have just they're they're evolving in splash life is always evolving and we can see it also in the space it's an entirely new species born in the space yeah that's completely different so we we find one species actually that we named after a donor to cornell someone who's donated funds to her research so he named a different species of fungus after him uh naganeshia tolchinsky because he's igor tolchinsky so as a thank you for him donating to cornell we said we've named this fungus that we found on the space station for you was he uh grateful or did he stop funding all research very grateful and then and i told him i said if you have like an ex-girlfriend we could try and name like a uh you know a genital fungus after her or something if you want and he said yeah he said maybe but he stopped answering him okay what about like in extreme conditions um in ice in heat is that something of interest to you and the things that survive where most things can't yes of keen interest i think that will be the road map for some of the potential adaptations what we could think of for human cells or certainly for our human the microbiome like just all the micro organisms in and on and around us so we've seen you know even there's this one crater it's called um the the lake of fire it's in turkmenistan where it's been on fire because of oil that had been set on fire decades ago and it's still burning so we collected some samples from there and those were some pseudomonas potatoes some species we found there that can so there's stuff alive there that seems to be surviving there by this large uh pit of fire oh yeah there is the desert it's been just on fire for decades apparently so this is another place though it's just the lake of fire yeah yeah and it's uh they said soviet scientists had set up a drilling rig here for extraction of natural gas of course it would be in this part of the world that you would get something like this but the rig collapsed and methane gas is being released from the crater yeah so for those just listening we're looking at a at a lake full of fire and there's something alive there allegedly and pseudometeos are known to be some of the most tough organs they actually can clean toxic waste from you know many years of superfund sites where there's so much waste that's been deposited you'll find them there as well actually there's one place in the gowanus canal we have something it's called in new york city in brooklyn and it is a complete toxic waste dump that was where a lot of waste in the 1700s was dumped and so the gateway to hell um is what it's called but the the the nickname [Laughter] so the the gowanus canal is also a place that has been fun to sequence and see so the pseudomonas species that can survive basically pulling toxins from the environment so it is if you create this toxic landscape and then evolution comes in and says fine i'll make things that can survive here and when you look at the biochemistry of those species what they've created is their own salvation basically the selection has made them survivors and suddenly you can use that to remediate other polluted sites for example so that explains twitter perfectly the toxicity created adaptation for the for the uh psychological microbiome that is uh social media okay uh beautiful but you um just actually jump back to the interstellar travel assuming the technology of today yes what are some wild innovations that might happen in the space of physics or biology by the way where do you think is the most exciting breakthroughs for interstellar travel that will happen in the next 500 years is it physics is it biology is it computer science so information or dna like some kind of informational type of thing is it biological like physiological making the body resilient um live longer and resilient to the harsh conditions of space or is it the actual vehicle of transport which would be applied physics as you can probably guess i'll say all the above the question but but to break those down though i think the ai i hope in the book later that we would have really good machine companions that the ai i really hope the ais that we build like realistically we are the programmers are making them i would feel the colossal failure if we didn't make ai that was embedded with a sense of duty and caretaking and friendship and even even creativity like we have the opportunity we're i've coded algorithms myself like we're building them so it would it's incumbent upon us to actually make them uh not you know i think frankly so just be uh technical actually on that point uh just to linger on the ai front can you still man the case that hal 9000 from space odyssey was doing the right thing so you know so for people who haven't seen 2001 space odyssey held 9000 is very kind of um focused on the mission cares a lot about the mission and uh kind of wants to hurt the astronauts that try to get in the way of the mission i think he was doing who's program to do which was just to follow the mission but didn't have a sense of you know think a broader duty you could i mean what's the broader duty exactly uh maintaining the the well-being of astronauts yeah or giving them another option i think you viewed them as like completely expendable rather than say not completely it's a trade-off well so like a doctor has to make decisions like this too you're restricted on the resources you have to make life and death decisions yeah so maybe hal 9000 had a long-term vision of what is good for the civilization back at home maybe a a deontogenic vision of what was the best duty uh for for the genetics you could say it's de-antigenic it's a word i made up in the book it's like what is your genetic duties when you think of my your dna right what are you supposed to do with it which is kind of the value of life but if hal was a silicon-based version of genetics which is just his own maintenance of himself and self-survival you could argue he's doing the right thing for himself but i think a human in that circumstance might have tried to find a way to uh even if the astronauts don't agree with the mission to figure out something to get them on a different spacecraft to go away or something versus just say well you're in the way of the mission i'll just you have to die is i think but accommodation candidates you've made to your point with doctors like sometimes you'd like to save three people but you can only save two yeah and you have to at some point pick but i think uh in that sense it's a false dichotomy i think hal didn't wasn't program two and didn't try to find a third solution perhaps the sex student russell proposes this idea that ai systems should have self-doubt they should be always uncertain in their final decision and that would help hal sort of get out of the local local optimum of this this is the mission like always be a little bit like i'm not sure if it's the right thing and then you're forced to kind of contend with other humans with other entities and what is the right decision um so like the the worst stuff the worst thing about decisions from that perspective is uh if you're extremely confident and you're stubborn and immovable right and then but as programming doubt is that sounds complicated that sounds like go wrong yes you can go wrong either way if you're too confident you won't see the other options if you have too much doubt you won't move you'll be paralyzed by the options so you need some middle ground which i think is what most people experience every day is we all love the concept of being a steadfast resolute leader making big decisions quickly and without question but at the same time we know people can be blinded to things they're missing if they're if they're two headstrong so so how would you improve hell 9000 i think i i would include other because hal is one program much like we do for humans you get feedback from other humans before you make a decision that affects all of them so i think hal could have gotten feedback from other ai systems that said well is this are there other options here and done it probably very quickly are you even you know embed a programming system where the ai has a primary function but at times of uncertainty queries a series of other programmed ai's to ask for a consensus almost i'm like a democracy of the ai but since it's all programmed you can bring it all together and say there's a primary but it only activates the parliament if you will for a decision when needed i don't know how you program dramatically different ais all in one system that are different enough but yeah conceptually it's possible of course that can lead to you know log jam and government parliament doesn't do anything or congress doesn't do anything yeah so there's trade-offs but it's one idea i i you know i'm sorry dave i'm afraid i can't do that that i'm really i find really compelling the idea i'd love to set that up in my own life at some point is um so you're stuck there on a spaceship yeah with an ai system it's just the two of you and you have to figure it out i love that challenge i love that um almost a really deep human conflict of through conversation have to arrive at something you you really try to understand what survival is at stake you have to try to understand the other being now you think it's just a robot we keep saying like it's just programmed but you know what when you talk to another human it's just a bag of meat you know it's and then and then you disagree and you're like you know everybody starts using terms like how dumb can you be how ignorant can you be yeah come on this is the right way what are you talking about this is you're what you're talking about is insane and when the stakes go up when when it's life and death you have to convince another person first you have to understand another person in this case you have to understand the machine the other the machine without knowing how it was programmed because yeah as a programmer even i mean this is very much true for the for these lego robots i really make sure that everything is that's programmed uh is sufficiently large and has a sufficient degree of uncertainty where i'm constantly surprised i don't know how it works i kind of know how it works but i'm surprised constantly and there there's a human component of trying to figure each other out and if it's high stakes life and death through conversation i mean to me that's actually what makes a great companion out in space it's like you're both in charge of each other's life and you both don't quite know how each other works and also you don't treat each other as a servant so i don't know if how hal was treated that way a little bit where you're like uh yeah like a servant as opposed to a friend a companion a teammate you know um because i think the the worst part about treating an ai system or or another human being as a servant is what it does to you if you treat them as a means to an end rather than end in of itself then you've debased them and and like lessen the humanity in yourself yeah at the same time which is which is i mean that's why they talked about kids have to be polite to alexa um because they find if they're you know if people are if kids are rude to ai systems they actually that it's a bad sign right it's it's a bad sign and it develops the wrong thing in terms of how they treat other uh human beings so that's ai so what about physics can we do in terms of can we travel close to the speed of light can we travel faster than the speed of light we can i i would love to fold space we know wormholes are technically possible but uh we have no way to do it i'd love to see advanced in wormhole technology antimatter drives antimatter is notoriously uh missing for most of the universe so what is antimatter drive antimatter would be where you used purified bits of antimatter basically it was the opposite of matter so if you can have an anti-electron to the electron you could have even a complete atoms that would be anti-atoms and when you put them together they would be pure energy released in theory and that could drive the most powerful possible engine for space travel but uh we you know that's the only place you can make antimatter is in large particle accelerators and only very briefly so that is hard but if that could work that would be extraordinary fusion drives would be great just getting nuclear fusion well controlled and that would actually give you a pretty good propulsion so i think that's the most likely thing we'll see is fusion drives fusion technology is getting better and better every year or it's that old saying fusion is always 10 years away every year it's always 10 years away but it's getting better and i think and saying is something that is a century old or less than a century old over multiple centuries that saying might might actually because the the fusion might actually become a reality for propulsion so that would be i think very likely to see in the next few centuries and then and then biology was the other part or anything else physics i mean physics you can imagine ways that have electromagnetic shielding so it could be you could deflect all the cosmic rays that are coming at your spacecraft with a large almost like force field quite frankly uh that would take some development to do but that would be good to see and uploading human memories and consciousness into digital form yeah this kind of blends the machine in physics with the biology developments and i think you know there's a lot of great work being done in longevity i have one of my companies itself works on longevity it's called longevity and so i i'm working on myself on ways to improve how we monitor health and wellness now and live longer live better many people are doing this is what the whole purpose of medicine is to a large degree but i don't think we'll live in the book i propose we might get out to a lived 150 years i think that's reasonable but say humans are going to have to be two three four five hundred years or some people i meet people like this every week because i think i'm not going to die to which i always say i hope you're right but i think you should plan that you're not going to be right but i want people also as we mentioned earlier being immortal would really fundamentally change the social contract and how you plan and how you allocate resources not necessarily bad but it would just be different but i also just think we don't know yet of any way to undo the ravages to the human body that occur over time we can repair some of it replace some of it but you know it's okay to assume that you're going to die and i just assume no you're going to die because then you have a bit of liberty about what you can do quickly and do next the uh but but i think we will get better i think we could see people live potentially to 150 with some of the tools and methods and living longer but upload you know living my in a living brain like in the kurzweil singularity where we all have this rapture-like moment and we go up and upload into the cloud and live forever um i don't know if it would still be the same as what we consider the view of self in this flesh form if we could really get a complete representation of a person's entire personality up into digital form i mean that would be immortality basically or a loose representation i'd go through the thought experiment of i like thinking about clones uh like twins twins are clones basically basically but um the ability to generate i mean you're stuck with the those cl like the twins is a fixed number of clones so that's a genetic clone i mean a philosophical clone where you can keep generating them versions and then i the reason i really like that construction thinking about that like for me personally is it nicely encapsulates how i feel about being human because why do i matter if i'm how would i if i do another copy of me how would i defend uh why i matter as a human being and i don't think i can because that clone if it's just fine not even a perfect like a reasonable clone like most people i know um that love me and who i love they'll be just fine with the corner they'd be like and some they'll be surprised like oh you're like your move kind of weird but like overall but otherwise i'll take it yeah and if that's possible to do that kind of copying and no i don't want to say perfect one because i think perfect cologne is very difficult engineering wise i mean like a pretty crappy copy would still be okay just like wears suits a lot has a weird way of talking i mean i think there's a lot of elements there like uh you know in the digital space especially with the metaverse you can clone i think you know in the next few decades you'll be able to clone people's behavioral patterns uh pretty well and visual uh at least in the in the virtual reality in the digital representation if you are and then you have to really contenders like why do i matter is maybe what matters isn't the individual person but what matters are the ideas that that person plays with um so it doesn't matter if there's a thousand clones what matters is that i'm currently thinking about x or some kind of problem that i'm trying to solve and those ideas and i'm sharing those ideas maybe ideas of the organisms and not the the meat vehicles of the organism maybe that's a cultural shift where we won't necessarily treat any one body as fundamentally uh unique or important but the sort of the ideas that those bodies play with i mean that sounds crazy no it's abstract abstract but very well and derek parfitt wrote this great book called reasons and persons about how you really define an individual is not just your own thoughts and your own self reflection but we're almost he argues more defined by how other people have seen you see like if you walked out into the world and say suddenly nobody knew who you were recognized you you would be in some regards deceased right if no one if everyone just suddenly had massive amnesia and you just didn't know who you are and never remember no memory of anything you'd ever done together you'd be very alone you'd be basically you know starting from scratch because you've just been born basically so and also you write thought experiments like what if half of your neurons get replaced with half of someone else or a quarter or 60 at what point do you stop being you and become that other person and the argument he makes is it's more than just what percentage of your neurons are swapped out it's also the relationships you have with so many people that partly define you no not completely but they're a key component of how you view yourself how they view what you are in the world and you know he actually goes so far to say that they're probably you know more important than even what's in your head like if you swap out you know all of your thoughts but when you walk out into the world everyone still treats you and talks you the same way as this memory of what you are that is like an entity that's defined you even if all of your you know there's even movies like trading spaces about this with eddie murphy or like these are people who can swap bodies uh the reason those are comedy is because they're fish out of water comedies and but but they go to the point of what defines you as not just you but also your viewed well you as an entity exist in the memories of other of other beings and so that yeah the the the entities as they exist in their form in those memories perhaps are more important to who you are than what's in your head and that clones then are um how do they do they lessen not really they just distribute they just scale the eunice that can be experienced by other humans like if i could be doing five podcasts right now at the same time then theory but i'd have to have some way to transmit the memory of which one i did which would be hard but not impossible if it's all digital you could aggregate and accrete more and more of the memories into one entity oh i see but i thought at the at the moment of cloning it's like cloning a git repository then you're no longer is branched you share you share the version view one of chris that a lot of people have experienced like your high school friends college friends colleagues and so on but now you moved on to your music career and one of your clones did and then that that's fundamentally new experiences that you you still um your colleagues can still experience the memories of the old christmas but the new one is totally you're going to have new communities experiencing connecting to those and then you can just propagate and the ones that are don't get a lot of likes on social media we can we can like quietly dispose of when it maximizes the clones of chris that can uh get a lot of likes on facebook okay uh on uh just returning briefly to moment uh the topic of ai are you working on ai stuff too a lot of machine learning tools for genomics yeah but because i i was seeing this interspersed because you're such a biology uh i mean i suppose computational biology person uh but what about the are you working on age of uh yes yeah like so i you've heard about the book i guess yeah yeah what that's actually written with the philanthropist i mentioned who we named the fungus after the space station so that's coming out uh next year actually yeah what's the effort there what's what's your interest in uh sort of the more narrow ai tools of prediction and machine learning all that kind of stuff yeah i think called the age of prediction so the next book that's coming is all the ways where machine learning tools predictive algorithms have fundamentally changed our life so some of them are obvious to me where for example when we sequence cancer patients dna and we have predictions of exactly which drug will work with it that's actually a very simple algorithm but other ones involve predicting say the age of blood that's left at the scene of a crime which uses computational tools to look at each piece of dna and what it might reveal for its epigenetic state and then predicting essentially how old you are at any given moment and that also gets to longevity because sometimes you can see if you're getting if you're aging faster or slower than you should be so some tools are in medicine or even forensics but my favorite part a lot of the book is where does this show up in economics as well as in medicine so predictive tools i mean i think the most notorious when people thought it was during the 2012 election and 2016 election especially we were seeing these really big differences of how facebook was monitoring feeds and so prediction is not just better medicine or in finance and economics people think about stock traders and people doing predictive algorithms but how you what you view in your feed how you what your vote is and and what you saw facebook did experiments they called it social contagion experiments to see can we restructure what people see and then how they respond actually kind of uh be really predictive and manipulative frankly with what happens and then can that change how they vote and the answers seem to be yes for a good amount of the populous in 2016 in the u.s so i think we're seeing more and more of these algorithms show up all over the place and so the book is about where they appear where they're good for example in medicine they're phenomenal they have fundamentally changed how we treat cancer patients but where they're risky like if someone's trying to steal your vote or manipulate your thoughts potentially negatively so in medicine you're hopeful about prediction yeah most of the ai and medicine the machine learning tools for image recognition for example for pathology samples where normally i think if someone takes a bit of a bit of tissue and then puts it onto a slide normally there's pathologists that have been training for years to look at a chunk of your tissue and say okay is this cancer what kind of cancer what treatment should i do but there's an old joke about pathologists that you can give 10 slides to 10 different pathologists and get 11 different diagnoses which is as awful as it sounds because you're having someone squint at a stained microscope slide but instead if you use a lot of the ai tools where you can actually segment the image high resolution characterization with multiple probes it's what ai was built to do you have a large training data set and then you have test samples afterward you can you can do far better than almost every pathologist on the planet and get a much more accurate diagnostic so that's for breast cancer for prostate cancer for leukemia we've seen the diagnostic tools explode with ai power is it currently mostly empowering doctors or can it replace doctors watson when notoriously was made by ibm to try and replace doctors i actually love ibm so i was in the room when we got a tour of watson for the first time with the dean of our medical school and uh these programmers came out and they said listen here's this example of a patient and watch watson diagnose the patient and recommend the right treatment and then at one point in the conversation remember this is the room of uh i'm a phd is like a geneticist some programmers some mds leaders of the of the medical school the dean is there and he says you could imagine someday this could replace doctors in a room full of doctors right so it was a really poor choice of words because everyone's like no you want to help the doctors but but i think the view from the programmers is often a bit naive that they could fundamentally replace doctors now in some cases they can for the pathology description as i just mentioned i think the ai tools already do a better job and we've only really been doing this for about five years right so you imagine another five years of optimization and data they're gonna take over right so and they should because staring and squinting at screens for hours on day is not the best use of human ingenuity so i think some cases they'll take over other cases they'll augment they'll help yeah that human ingenuity actually especially for ai people sometimes difficult to characterize they have this debate all the time about autonomous driving they're it's a lot more difficult than people realize you're an expert or you focus a lot on that for your research right now i'm an expert in nothing except in not being an expert i think um or asking stupid questions with the answers both okay um but if there is some ingenuity that's hard to kind of encapsulate that is human for doctor the decision making it's the hal 9000 thing you can have a perfect system that has able to know the optimal answer but there's some human element that's missing and sometimes the sub-optimal answer in the long term is the right one it's the self-doubt that is essential for human progress that's weird i'm not not sure what that is if i can let me ask you to be the wise old sage and give advice to young people today sure in high school in college about how to have a career they can be proud of or maybe a life they can be proud of on this planet or or others yeah i think for the padawans out there and young younglings looking up at the stars you have to know that this day that you're alive is quantifiably the best day that's ever happened and that tomorrow will be even better than this day in terms of the capacity for discovery the amount of data that exists again it's not my opinion that's just an empirical fact of the state of genetics research knowledge accretion of humanities acumen for many disciplines so with that ability to do so many things it can be sometimes just terrifying well what do i pick if i could do everything and this is the most possibility ever in human history how do you pick one thing to do and that's just the thing what do you find yourself daydreaming about what's the thing that you uh what keeps you up at night if you don't have anything that keeps you up at night sometimes you go find something that keeps you up at night because that is kind of this sometimes i feel like if i get woken up by the someone on the inside of my skull who's knocking trying to get out it's kind of that almost haunting feeling of i need to wake up there's things that have to be done there are questions i i don't know the answer to and there's a lot of times as simple as how do we engineer cells to survive more radiation but what i have i read a paper and then it came back to me a week later as hell wait we could use some of these tools or these genes or these methods really you know being pleasantly haunted by something is a wonderful place to be and and find that thing that that bothers you because there'll be good days and there'll be bad days but you want to have even on the worst possible days working on the thing that you love the most and then all the usual you know normal phrases apply like then you never work a day in your life if you have a job you love the usual phrases but yes but it's true and it and it's actually really hard to find i think a lot of times you'll have to do work for random jobs that maybe you don't like for five or even ten years right or you may have to go to school for 10 to 15 to 20 years to finally get to the right spot where you have the knowledge the experience and even frankly just reputation that people trust you you've done enough good work and only then can you really do the thing you love most but so you have to be a little bit patient maybe a little bit patient and impatient at the same time you have to do both and the interesting thing is when you're trying to find that that thing that um that excites you you have to especially in this modern world i think silence the distractions yeah because um once you find that thing you hear that little voice in your head there's still instagram and tick tock and video games and other exciting sort of dopamine rushes that can like pull you away yeah and make it seem like they're the same thing but they're not really there's some little flame there that um that's longer lasting and i i think you have to silence everything else to let that sort of flame become a fire um so it's interesting because so much of the internet is designed to uh convert that natural predisposition that humans have to get excited about stuff convert that into like attention and money and ads and so on yeah it's everywhere but like we have to be conscious of that i think a lot of that is full of fun and it's awesome i think tech talk and instagram that's full of fun amazing yeah and creativity leads to people making amazing videos or even doing people my daughter loves tik tok and you know people who do makeup art on tick tock of things that are mind-blowing you think they they made that video just to put it on tiktok and practice their art and share it with the world it's fabulous but but then if my daughter watches tick-tock for like three hours straight i'm like what are you doing exactly and she's like well you know so so it's hard because but i mean when i was a kid i mean i played nintendo i sometimes would play for like 10 hours a day even in grad school i'd sometimes play like counter-strike or half-life like 12 hours straight now like what was i did so after when at one point i built a new computer i just didn't install some of the games i had before i was like i'm just gonna not install them because otherwise i'll play them for too long yeah i would love to get props from the team uh i would love to uh lay out all the things i've ever done in my life to myself because i think i would be less judgmental of others and less understanding more patient because the amount of hours i spent playing like diablo and like video like is insane i'm sure it adds up to like weeks maybe months of my life that it was just you know but i feel like i was probably i tell myself at least i was problem solving right i could say hand-eye coordination or that's an old i don't know if that really is even remotely true but uh some of the games like final fantasy things or things we actually had to solve problems and think and they were some degree of strategy but they were actually just expanding the diversity of human character that makes up you it's like you can't just focus on none that you can't but perhaps it's more beneficial to focus to not focus on a singular thing for many many years at a time that could be one of the downsides of p if a phd if you're not careful is that you become too singularly focused not just on the problem but on a particular community and you don't do wild stuff you don't do interdisciplinary stuff you don't go out painting or getting drunk or dancing whatever the variety whatever injects variety to the to the years of difficult reading research paper after research paper that whole process um you have to be very careful to add variety into it and maybe that involves playing a little bit of counter-strike or diablo whatever floats your boat we're dancing well new york city is a great place but there's there's sunrise rooftop dancing they've got a party that does this and that's the thing it's a thing so you go there uh some people from my lab that go i've only been once but like at sunrise and you see the sun rise over the city and there's huge house music and you play and you dance like crazy and then you go to work you know you go to lab you go to wherever you go but you can it's good to squeeze in some weird crazy sun sunrise rooftop dancing or things like that when you can if we can if we may to uh to some difficult dark places uh i'll bring a flashlight maybe something um find something that can warm your soul or inspires others is there dark periods dark times in your life that you had to overcome yeah like many people uh had friends i've lost that friend when i was younger committed suicide and that was actually um i remember being so struck of i couldn't understand it i didn't uh i understood mental illness at the time i was very young i was only like 11 at the time and i really was confused more than anything else about how how could someone take their life and i actually once i got over sort of the the grief of it all i really it cemented in my head that i would you know never commit suicide i could tell this to my wife it's like you know if like if it looks like i hung myself go find my killer because i would never do it yeah it's got to be staged and you know but at the same time i've begun to appreciate there are times where the suffering is so great and diseases can be so awful that uh sometimes you know euthanasia it is a as an actual exit but i uh just have friends i've lost along the way or or um but but that's not too different everyone has people they've lost along the way but actually um was never never too dark of a childhood or a dark place i mean the hardest things have been really weird relationship breakups where i felt like you know love falling in love and then losing that person just breaking up not like they died but where you felt like you know you just could barely move like you literally felt like your heart was moved in your body to a different location and uh that sort of scraping sense of existence but but also at the same time that's been where i've in some ways been the most alive where i lost the what i thought at the time was the love of my life and but then uh was able to actually i think carve a deeper trench into my heart which then could be filled more with joy i would i would say is what uh pablo neruda wrote about this and khalil gibran is that the deepest deepest sorrows i think later have translated into my life as to places that can be filled with greater amounts of joy i love thinking of sorrows as a digging of a ditch that can then be filled with more good stuff eventually not at the time but for a while just a giant empty cavern full of like blood and tears and pain but then yeah it comes later uh there is an element to life where this too shall pass yeah so any moment of sorrow or joy it's gonna be over and like uh treasure it no matter what i mean i do definitely think of about losing love that's like a celebration of love in in in even any any living i think is better that's why i just adamantly i don't think i'd ever really commit suicide because anything i take is better than than nothing like i said the worst case scenario said there's no heaven there's no hell it's just it like if you just die and that's really just it then anything that you have in living is by definition infinitely better than the zero because it's at least it's something and so i appreciate said i have to enjoy sadness which sounds like an oxymoron but i sometimes even long for a good sadness like a like a rainy day and i'm staring out a window squinting and like drinking some underpriced whiskey and then you know and and just moping and like what are you doing like i'm just moping today and i just but i want at least one day where i did that or something i actually had a conversation offline with uh rick rubin he's a music producer about this he's he told me um he has a way of speaking that's all like sage-like and he says be careful that you um spend some time appreciating that sadness but don't become addicted that that there's a line you can cross and then you actually push away the joy because you feel like the because the sadness can be all encompassing and therefore even more real than what might seem like fleeting happiness uh yes so yeah yeah right you can uh sadness if if you let it can be a thing that stays with you longer and stickier yeah but you um but just witnessing suicide made you appreciate life more yeah i mean just an appreciation to death is actually an appreciation of life at the same time are you uh afraid of your death no do you think about it i i think it's it's like being afraid of the sunrise it's it's it doesn't make sense so you're you're part of this like fabric that is humanity and then you just think generationally yeah i think i want to do as much as i can like i'll i feel like i would die i feel like i've lived in full life already i actually believe that since age 17 onward i feel like even then i mean then the bar was low i feel like well i had at least sex once i had had good friends what else is right at that age but then i had also uh really read a lot of philosophy had traveled a bit felt like i'd started at least see the world and had lived a somewhat of a life but that from then on i felt like uh that i wouldn't feel like i was cheated if i had died from that day forward that i had gotten at least enough of life to feel like the that i wouldn't i would be not okay with dying but that i feel like i i knew i was going to die i wasn't afraid i was going to die and it actually was very liberating and it's only gotten better since then so i think you know some of that might it may or may not have been drug related euphoria but nonetheless the the joy stuck and i think it was it's just gotten more true ever since is that the the default state is one of very rich appreciation because there's uh it's so fleeting and so any i know i would i knew i would die happy i guess even at age 17 but now my my metrics have changed a little bit it's not i've had sex more than one time now so that's really big congratulations this is very exciting at least four times but empathy multiples um and professionally accomplished things like i could actually do some of the genetic dreams i had when i was 16 or 17 i'm not actually making them in my lab i actually like to say my my scientific goals and statements have really been the same since i've been 17. it's just now everyone takes me seriously because i'm a professor and actually i've done that you're mentoring people you're the next generation yeah also patients yeah and helping patients live longer and seeing the hope in their eyes when they went from even my own grandfather went from a two-month diagnostic diagnosis of living from metastatic cancer to living for more than two years eventually succumbed to it but knowing can use the tools of predictive medicine to save people um yeah and so now you know looking out ahead uh i feel like it's i would die very happy if i saw boots on the red planet and and people there and now the other advice to the younglings i'd say is the first time i proposed the twin study to nasa they said no uh several times said no we don't we're not a plan for a mission like that it's not going to happen so uh don't you know be just perseverance that will in the east you were i didn't know i i knew you were part of leading the nasa twin study but you were also part of the failure to do so earlier so the first actually because when you start a lab in academia they say here's a pile of money yes write grants and bring in more money and train people and start a lab but so i actually wrote nasa and said i don't i'm not requesting any funds i have funds they just gave me a bunch of money i would like to though do a deep genetic profile of astronauts before and after space flight and do it ideally if we have some twins or do genetics and epigenetics and microbiome but john charles is the director of the human research programs that we don't have we don't even have those samples bank that you would want to for the that are old samples and we don't have any plans for missions like that right now so uh we can't do it and that was the first time i you know it's like it's like saying to someone that listen i'll i'll buy a house for you i just have this mile by and like uh no no thanks because i felt like i was offering a really unique research opportunity but then that you know failure of saying that we're not ready yet it's not time but then once they have the solicitation then he reached out and said oh actually i think we've got something along the lines of what you were thinking a few years ago so sometimes when some things get rejected or someone says no say okay maybe it's just too early but don't don't give up i think and say um you know so to me when someone says no not right now i'd be like okay i'll just i'll come back in a year no just means no for now then so if i think sometimes no means you have a crappy idea that is true they can i do have crappy ideas and so does everybody but if i really believe in it i just say okay i'll be back yeah this too shall pass the no um do you hope to go out to iss out to deep space one day i would love to go i want to be a little bit older so that if i die it's not as traumatic for my daughter and family but um yeah i feel like if i'm a little bit older i definitely i would even potentially do a one-way trip to mars if it's later in life so would you like to do you think you will step foot on mars i would love to and i think i might i think the it may be that one-way trip if they because i think they'll need settlers who would want to go and stay there and build and be there for the long term knowing it's high risk knowing it's and your resume fits so you'll have a lot of cool stuff to do there yeah at least on the surface you'll be able to sell yourself well um resilience experience motivation would that make you sad to die in mars looking back at the planet you were born on no i think it would be actually in some ways maybe the best way to die knowing that you're on the first wave of people expanding the reaching of the stars it'd be an honor why do you think we're here what's the meaning of life to serve as the guardians of life itself that is a the the duty for our species is is to recognize and really manifest this unique responsibility that we have and only we have so far so i think yeah to me the the meaning of life is for life to it in its simplest form is to be able to survive but to leverage the frailty of life into its ability to protect itself and quite literally the guardians of the galaxy is basically what we are regarding light regarding ourselves and also life i mean life is just so precious as far as we know it is completely rare in the universe and i do think a lot well what if it what if this is the only universe that's ever come in and it won't come back again and like this is it and if that's true we have to serve as shepherds leverage the frailty of life to protect it and this is all life so we get the opportunity we humans get the opportunity to be smart enough to be clever enough to be motivated enough to actually protect the other life that's on this including ai including life that's to come that might be very different from what we imagined today and that would make you sad if we were replaced by the kind and uh the kind or smarter ai no i think about that in the book a bit of that i think i i would be okay with it if they carry some echo of that duty and they bring that with them uh it would be real i'd be sad if they like to hell with everyone we're gonna destroy everything we come across and become like nanobots that make everything gray goo that seems but that would still be a version of life just not one that is as i think is pretty but technically it'd be alive so like you know philosophically could i object uh it's borderline yeah but romantically no romantic there's they need to carry the duty there's some yes yeah there's a bit of a romance to the philosophy it's in there and you also uh end the book with a universe that creates new universes uh so if this isn't the only universe do you think that's in our future that we might launch new universe new offspring universes it's very possible i mean multiverse is a controversial field because it's very much hypothetical but with this universe has been created the one we're in now and so it's happened before it certainly could happen again some of them might be happening in parallel i i think you know if you look out billions of years trillions of years in the future of technological development certainly possible we could start to have little baby universes grow them like cabbage yeah get them out saute them make them have flavor uh yeah create something delicious well it sounds difficult but it's our human duty to try as you said chris this is an incredible conversation you're an incredible person a scientist explorer i can't wait to see what you do in this world and i um hope to be there with you on mars i would like to also um breathe my last breath on that sexy red planet that's our neighbor podcast for mars at least space i think space should be coming base is
