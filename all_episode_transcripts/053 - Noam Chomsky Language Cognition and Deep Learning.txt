the following is a conversation with Noam Chomsky he's truly one of the great minds of our time and is one of the most cited scholars in the history of our civilization he has spent over 60 years at MIT and recently also joined the University of Arizona where we met for this conversation but it was at MIT about four and a half years ago when I first met Noam in my first few days there I remember getting into an elevator at Stata Center pressing the button for whatever floor looking up and realizing was just me and Noam Chomsky riding the elevator just me in one of the seminal figures of linguistics cognitive science philosophy and political thought in the past century if not ever I tell that silly story because I think life is made up of funny little defining moments they never forget for reasons that may be too poetic to try and explain that was one of mine Noam has been an inspiration to me and millions of others it was truly an honor for me to sit down with him in Arizona I travelled there just for this conversation and in a rare heartbreaking moment after everything was set up and tested the camera was moved and accidentally the recording button was pressed stopping the recording so I have good audio of both of us but no video of Noam just the video of me and my sleep-deprived but excited face and I get to keep as a reminder of my failures most people just listen to this audio version for the podcast as opposed to watching it on YouTube but still it's heartbreaking for me I hope you understand and still enjoy this conversation as much as I did the depth of intellect that Noam showed and his willingness to truly listen to me a silly-looking Russian in the suit it was humbling and something I'm deeply grateful for as some of you know this podcast is a side project for me where my main journey and dream is to build AI systems that do some good for the world this latter effort takes up most of my time but for the moment has been mostly private but the former the podcast is something I put my heart and soul into and I hope you feel that even when I screw things up I recently started doing ads at the end of the introduction I'll do one or two minutes after introducing the episode and never any ads in the middle that break the flow of the conversation I hope that works for you it doesn't hurt the listening experience this is the artificial

of engineering a better world and now here's my conversation with Noam Chomsky I apologize for the absurd philosophical question but if an alien species were to visit earth do you think we would be able to find a common language or protocol of communication with them there are arguments to the effect that we could in fact one of them was Marvin Minsky's back about twenty or thirty years ago he performed a brief experiment with a student of his den Bob burrower they essentially ran the simplest possible Turing machines just free to see what would happen and most of them crashed either got into an infinite loop or lost stopped the few that persisted essentially gave something like arithmetic and his conclusion from though was that if some alien species developed IR intelligence they would at least have arithmetic they would at least have what the simplest computer would do and in fact the he didn't know that at the time but the core principles of natural language are based on operations which yields something like arithmetic in the limiting case and a minimal case so it's conceivable that a mode of communication could be established based on the core properties of human language and the core properties of arithmetic which maybe are universally shared so it's conceivable what is the structure of that language of language as an internal system inside our mind versus an external system as its expressed it's not an alternative it's two different concepts of language different it's a simple fact that there's something about you a trait of yours part of your the organism you that determines that you're talking English and not the Tagalog let's say so there is an inner system its determines the sound and meaning of the infinite number of expressions of your language it's localized it's not on your foot of these leads in your brain if you look more closely it's in specific configurations of your variant and that's essentially like the internal structure of your laptop whatever programs it has or in there now one of the things you can do with language it's a marginal thing in fact is use it to to externalize what's in your head actually most of your use of languages thought internal thought but you can do what you and I are now doing we can externalize it well the set of things that we're externalizing are an external system if there are noises in the atmosphere and you can call that language in some other sense of the word but it's not a it's not a set of alternatives these are just different concepts so how deep do the roots of language go in our brain our mind is it yet another feature like vision or is it something more fundamental from which everything else Springs in are in the human mind well it's in a way it's like vision there's a you know there's something about our genetic endowment that determines that we have a mammalian rather than a insect visual system and there's something in her genetic endowment that turned that determines that we have a human language faculty no other organism has anything remotely similar so in that sense its internal now there is a long tradition which I think is valid going back centuries to the early Scientific Revolution at least that holds that language is the sort of the core of human cognitive nature it's the source its the mode for constructing thoughts and expressing them that is what forms thought and it's got fundamental creative capacities it's free independent unbounded and so on and doubtedly I think the basis for creative capacities and the other remarkable human capacities that lead to the unique achievements and not-so-great achievements of the species the capacity to think and reason do you think that's deeply linked with language do you think the way we the internal language system is essentially the mechanism by which we also reason internally it is undoubtedly the mechanism by which we reasoned there may also be other fact there are undoubtedly other faculties involved in reasoning we have a kind of scientific faculty nobody knows what it is but whatever it is that enables us to pursue certain lines of endeavor and inquiry and to decide what makes sense and doesn't make sense and to achieve certain degree of understanding of the world that's uses language but goes beyond it just as using our capacity for arithmetic is not the same as having the capacity idea of capacity our biology evolution you've talked about it defining essentially our capacity our limit and our scope can you try to define what limited scope are and the bigger question do you think it's possible to find the limit of human cognition well that's an interesting question it's it's commonly believed most scientists believe that human intelligence can answer any question in principle I think that's a very strange belief if we were biological organisms which a not angels then we our capacities ought to have scope and limits which are interrelated can define the state terms well let's take let's take a concrete example your genetic endowment determines that you can have a million visual system their arms and legs and so on but it and therefore become a rich complex organism but if you look at that same genetic endowment it prevents you from to have developing in other directions there's no kind of experience which would yield the embryo to develop an insect visual system or to develop wings instead of arms so the very endowment that confers richness and complexity also sets bounds on what it could what can be attained now I assume that our cognitive capacities are part of the organic world therefore they should have the same properties if they had no built-in capacity to develop a rich and complex structure we would have understand nothing Africa just as if your genetic endowment did not compel you to develop arms and legs you would just be some kind of a random amoeboid creature with no structure at all so I think it's plausible to assume that there are limits and I think we even have some evidence as to what they are so for example there's a classic moment in the history of science at the time of Newton there was a from Galileo to Newton modern science developed on a fundamental assumption which Newton also accepted namely that the world is an entire universe is a mechanical object and by mechanical they meant something like the kinds of artifacts that were being developed by skilled artisans all over Europe the gears and levers and so on and the other their belief was well the world is just a more complex variant of this Newton to his astonishment and distress proved that there are no machines that there's interaction without contact his contemporaries like liveness and Huygens just dismissed this is returning to the mysticism of the Neo scholastics a Newton agreed as you've said it is totally absurd no person of any scientific intelligence could ever accept this for a moment in fact he spent the rest of his life trying to get around it somehow as did many other scientists that was the very criterion of intelligibility for say Galileo or Newton theory did not produce an intelligible world unless he could duplicate it in a machine he's heard you can't there are no machines Annie finally after a long struggle took a long time scientists just accepted this as common sense but that's a significant moment that means they abandoned the search for an intelligible world and the great philosophers of the time understood that very well so for example David Hume in his comeon to Newton wrote that it was the greatest thinker ever and so on he said that he unveiled the secret many of the secrets of nature but by showing the imperfections of the mechanical philosophy mechanical science he left us with he showed that there are mysteries which ever will remain on science just changed its its goals it abandoned the mysteries it can't solve it put sigh we only look for intelligible theories newton's theories were intelligible and it's just what they described wasn't well what I feel ox said the same thing I think they're basically right and if so that should something about the limits of human cognition we cannot attain the goal of development of understanding the world of a finding an intelligible world this mechanical philosophy Galileo to Newton at this good case can be made that that's our instinctive conception of how things work so if they infants are tested with things that if this moves and then this moves they kind of invent something that must be invisible that's in between them that's making the movements Noah yeah we like physical contact something about our brain makes makes us want a world like that just like it wants a world that has regular geometric figures so for example Descartes pointed this out that if you have a an infant who's never seen a triangle before and you draw a triangle the infant will see a distorted triangle not whatever crazy figure it actually is you know three lines not coming quite together or one of them a little bit curved and so on we just impose a conception of the world in terms of geometric perfect geometric objects it's now been shown that goes way beyond that that if you show on a to kiss the scope let's say a couple of lights shining you do it three or four times in a row what people actually see is a rigid object in motion not whatever is there that's we all know that from a television set they see so that gives us hints of potential limits to our cognition I think it does but it's a very contested view if you do a poll among scientists impossible we can understand anything let me ask and give me a chance with this so I just spent a day at a company called neural link and what they do is try to design what's called the brain machine brain computer interface so they tried to do thousands readings in the brain being able to read what the neurons are firing and then stimulate back so to weigh do you think their dream is to expand the capacity of the brain to attain information sort of increase the bandwidth of which we can search Google kind of thing do you think our cognitive capacity might be expanded our linguistic capacity our ability to reason might be expanded by adding a machine into the picture can be expended in a certain sense but a sense that was known thousands of years ago a book expands your elegant capacity okay so this will could expand it too but it's not a fundamental expansion it's not totally new things could be understood well nothing that goes beyond our native cognitive capacities just like you can't turn the visual system into an insect system well I mean the the thought is the thought is perhaps you can't directly but you can map so the hood but we already we know that without this experiment right you could map what a bee sees and presented in the form so that we could follow it fact every bee scientist doesn't but you don't think there's something greater than bees that we can map and then all of a sudden discover something be able to understand a quantum world quantum mechanics be able to start to be able to make sense the students at MIT you study and understand quantum mechanics but they always reduce it to the infant the physical I mean they don't really understand it oh you don't there's thing that may be another area where there's just a limit to understand it we understand the theories but world that it describes doesn't make any sense so you know the experiment the Schrodinger's cat for example can understand the theory but as Ruettiger pointed out it's an unintelligible world one of the reasons why Einstein was always very skeptical about quantum theory he described himself as a classical realist Winston in montant eligibility he has something in common with infants in that way so back to linguistics if you could humor me what are the most beautiful or fascinating aspects of language are ideas and linguistics or cognitive science that you've seen in a lifetime of studying language and studying the human mind well I think the deepest property of language and puzzling property that's been discovered is what are sometimes called structure dependence we know understand it pretty well but was puzzling for a long time I'll give you a concrete example so suppose you say the guy who fixed the car carefully packed his tools it's ambiguous he could fix the car carefully or carefully package tools I suppose you put carefully in front carefully the guy who fixed the car packed his tools then it's carefully packed not carefully fixed and in fact you do that even if it makes no sense so suppose you say carefully the guy who fixed the car is tall you have to interpret it as carefully he stole even though that doesn't make any sense and notice that that's a very puzzling fact because you're relating carefully not to the linearly closest verb but to the linear remotely more remote for a linear approach this is a easy computation but here you're doing a much more what looks like a more complex copy you're doing something that's taking you essentially to the more remote thing it's now understand if you look at the actual structure of the sentence you know where the phrases are and so on turns out you're picking out the structurally closest thing but the linearly more remote thing but notice that what's linear is a hundred percent of what you hear you never hear structure can't so what you're doing is and instantly this is universal all constructions all languages and what we're compelled to do is carry out what looks like the more complex computation on material that we never hear and we ignore a hundred percent of what we hear and the simplest computation but now there's even a neural basis for this that's somewhat understood and there's good theories but now that explains why it's true that's a deep insight into the surprising nature of language with many consequences let me ask you about a field of machine learning deep learning there's been a lot of progress in neural networks based neural network based machine learning in the recent decade of course neural network research goes back many decades what do you think are the limits of deep learning of neural network based machine learning well to give a real answer to that you'd have to understand the exact processes that are taking place and those are pretty opaque so it's pretty hard to prove a theorem about what can be done and what can't be done but I think it's reasonably clear I'm inputting technicalities aside but deep learning is doing is taking huge numbers of examples and finding some patterns ok that's could be interesting in some areas it is but we have to ask you a certain question is it engineering or is it science Engineering in the sense of just trying to build something that's useful or science in the sense that it's trying to understand something about elements of the world so it takes a google parser we can ask that question is it useful you know it's pretty useful you know I use a google translator so on engineering grounds it's kind of worth having like a bulldozer does it tell you anything about human language zero nothing and in fact it's very striking too it's from the very beginning it's just totally remote from science so what does a Google parser doing it's taking an enormous text let's say the Wall Street Journal corpus and asking how close can we come to getting the right description of every sentence in the corpus well every sentence in the corpus is essentially an experiment this each sentence that you produce is the is an experiment which is a Maya grammatical sentence the answer is usually yes so most of the stuff in the corpus is grammatical sentences but now ask yourself is there any science which takes random experiments which are carried out for no reason whatsoever and tries to find out something from them like if you're a say a chemistry PhD student you want to get a thesis can you say well I'm just gonna do a lot of mix mix a lot of things together no no purpose just and maybe I'll find something you'd be left out of the department science tries to find critical experiments ones that answer some theoretical question doesn't care about coverage of millions of experiments so it just begins by being very remote from science and it continues like that so the usual question that's asked about see a Google parser is how well does it do or some parse or how well does it do on a corpus but there's another question that's never asked how well does it do on something that violates all the rules of language so for example take the structure defendants case that I mentioned suppose there was a language in which he used linear proximity that's the mode of interpretation these deep learning had worked very easily on that fact much more easily than an actual language is that a success no that's a failure from a scientific point of view it's a failure that it doesn't it shows that we're not discovering the nature of the system at all thus it does just as well or even better on things that violate the structure of the system and it goes on from there it's not an argument against doing it it is useful to have devices like this so yes neural networks the kind of approximate errs that look there's echoes of the behavioral debates right behavioral is about more than echoes many of the people in deep learning say they've indicated yeah Terry Sandusky for example in his recent book says this vindicates Skinnerian behaviour it doesn't have anything to do with it yes but I think there's something actually fundamentally different when the data set is huge but your point is extremely well taken but do you think we can learn approximate that interesting complex structure of language what neural networks they will somehow help us understand the science possible I mean you find patterns that you hadn't noticed let's say could be in fact it's very much like a kind of linguistics it's done what's called corpus linguistics when you suppose you have some language where all the speakers have died out but you have records so you just look at the records and see what you can figure out from that it's much better than it's much better to have actual speakers where you can do critical experiments but if they're all dead you can't do them so you have to try to see what you can find out from just looking at the data that's around you can learn things actually paleoanthropology is very much like that and you can't do a critical experiment on what happened two million years ago so you kind of forced just to take what data's around and see what you can figure out from it okay it's a serious study so let me venture into another whole body of work and philosophical question you've said that evil and Society arises from institutions not inherently from our nature do you think most human beings are good they have good intent or do most have the capacity for intentional evil that depends on they're bringing depends on their environment on context I wouldn't say that they don't arise from our nature anything we do arises from our nature and the fact that we have certain institutions and not others is one mode in which human nature has expressed itself but as far as we know human nature could yield many different kinds of institutions the particular ones that have developed have to do with historical contingency the who conquered whom and that sort of thing then they're not rooted they're not rooted in our nature in the senses they were central to our nature so it's commonly argued that these days that something like market systems is just part of our nature but we know from a huge amount of evidence that that's not true there's all kinds of other structures it's a particular packet of modern history others have argued that the roots of classical liberalism actually argue that that what's called sometimes an instinct for freedom too interesting to be free of domination by illegitimate Authority is the core of our nature that would be the officer to this and we don't know we just know that human nature can accommodate both kinds if you look back at your life is there a moment in your intellectual life or life in general that jumps from memory that brought you happiness that you would love to relive again sure falling in love having children what about so you have put forward into the world a lot of incredible ideas in linguistics in cognitive science in terms of ideas that just excites you when it first came to you you would love to relive those moments well I mean when you make a discovery about something that's exciting like say it's true even the observation of structure dependence and on from that the explanation for it but the major things just seem like common sense so if you go back to take your question about external and internal language you go back to say the 1950s almost entirely language is regarded an external object something outside the mine it just seemed obvious as that can't be true like I said there's something about you that says determines your told me English not Swahili or something and but that's not really discovery that's just an observation with transparent you might say it's kind of like the 17th century the beginnings of modern science 17th century they they came from being willing to be puzzled about things that seemed obvious so it seems obvious that a heavy ball of little for faster than a light pole of lead but Galileo was not impressed by the fact that it seemed obvious so he wanted to know if it's true that he carried out experiments actually thought experiments never actually carried them out which I can't be true you know and out of you know things like that observations of that kind you know what white is a a ball fall to the ground instead of rising let's name it seemed seems obvious do you start thinking about it because why does it white esteem Ryan's name and I think the beginnings of modern linguistics roughly in the fifties they're kind of like that just being willing to be puzzled about the phenomena that looked from some point of view obvious and for example a kind of doctrine most official doctrine of structural linguistics in the 50s was that languages can differ from one another in arbitrary ways and each one has to be studied on its own without any presuppositions in fact they were similar views among biologists about the nature of organisms that each one's are so different when you look at them that almost anything you could be almost anything well in both domains it's been learned that that's very far from true they're very narrow constraints on what could be an organism or what could be a language but these are you know that's just the nature of inquiry science in general yet inquiry so one of the peculiar things about us human beings is our mortality Ernest Becker explored it in general do you ponder the value of mortality do you think about your own mortality I used to when I was about 12 years old I wondered I didn't care much about my own mortality but I was worried about the fact that if my consciousness disappeared with the entire universe disappear that was frightening did you ever find an answer to that question no nobody's ever found an answer but I stopped being bothered by it it's kind of like Woody Allen and one of his films you may recall he starts he goes to a shrink when he's a child and shrink yes and what's your problem he says I just learned that the universe is expanding I can't handle that and in another absurd question is what do you think is the meaning of our existence here are the life on Earth now briefly at a moment in time think we answered by our own activities there's no general answer we determined what the meaning of it is the action determining meaning meaning in the sense of significance not meaning in the sense that chair means this you know but the significance of your life is something you create No thank
