what is the heroic action for scientists in nazi germany science in many respects actually is a full collaborator in the most horrific forms of nazi genocide nazi exclusion what goes to the mind of a big tobacco executive cigarettes have killed more than any other object than all the world of iron all the world of gunpowder nuclear bombs have only killed a few hundred thousand people cigarettes have killed hundreds of millions there's no contest cigarettes have killed far more and are far more preventable what is the nature of human ignorance the following is a conversation with robert proctor historian at stanford university specializing in 20th century science technology and medicine especially the history of the most controversial aspects of those fields please allow me to say a few words about science and the nature of truth the word science is often used as an ideal for a methodology that can help us escape the limitation of any one human mind in the pursuit of truth the underlying idea here is that individual humans are too easily corrupted by bias emotion personal experience and the usual human craving for meaning money power and fame and the hope is that the tools of science can help us overcome these limitations in striving for deeper and deeper understanding of objective reality from physics to chemistry biology genetics and even psychology cognitive science and neuroscience but history shows that these tools of science are not devoid of human flaws of influence from human institutions of manipulation from people in power as we talk about in this conversation with robert proctor in the 1930s and 40s there was the nazi science and there was communist science and each had fundamentally different ideas about for example genetics and biology of disease this history also shows that scientists can be corrupted slowly or quickly by fear fame money or just the ideological narratives of a charismatic leader that convinces each scientist and the scientific community that their work matters for the greater cause of humanity even if that cause involves the genetic purification of a people the extermination of a cancer and the unrestricted experimentation on the bodies of living beings who do not have a voice whose suffering will never be heard all of this for the greater good in some periods of human history science was deeply influenced by the ideology of governments and individuals in some less so the hard truth is that we can't know for sure about which of the two periods we're living through today so let us not too quickly dismiss the voices of experts and non-experts alike that ask the simple question of wait are we doing the right thing here are we helping or hurting are we adding suffering to the world or are we alleviating it most such voices are nothing more than martyrs seeking fame not truth and they will be proven wrong but some may help prevent future atrocities and suffering at a global scale let us then move forward with humility so that history will remember this period as one of human flourishing and where science lived up to its highest ideal this is the lex friedman podcast to support it please check out our sponsors in the description and now dear friends here's robert proctor what is the story of science and scientists doing the rise rule and fall of the third reich well we tend to think of science as always on the side of liberty as always on the side of enlightenment as always on the side of enlarging human possibility and here we have this phenomenon in the 1930s of really the world's leading scientific power the third reich which collectively had won a big chunk of all the nobel prizes suddenly they go fascists they go nazi with hitler and instead of being primarily a source of resistance science in many respects actually is a full collaborator in the most horrific forms of nazi genocide nazi exclusion and uh that's kind of a a relatively untold story in the sense that uh when we think of science in the third reich we think of joseph mingley injecting dye into the eyes of twins or we think of horrific human experiments and those are real but it's also the story of a huge scientific apparatus a bureaucracy you could almost say participating in every phase of the uh campaigns of nazi destruction and what i looked at in particular in in actually my first book was how physicians in particular but also biomedical science was collaborating with the regime and that it's wrong to think of the nazi regime as anti-science it's anti-a particular type of science in particular it was radically against what they call jewish science communist science certain types of science they did not like there's a whole nature nurture dispute in that period and they're firmly on the side of nature which interestingly gives bias to rise to a very different type of science in the soviet union by the way the soviet union is more on the nurture side the soviet union is on the side of the nurture side in the dimension of genetics and this is sort of an untold story i was actually going to write a book about it until i was barred from access to the soviet union there have been different times in my life where i was a russianist a russian okay we're gonna have to talk about that but i got excluded from uh fulfilling that dream but one of the things i was gonna look at when i got a fulbright in the 1980s was to go over and look at the anti-nazi genetics and anthropology of the soviets and how a lot of their lysincoast lamarcism was actually anti-nazi anti-genetics on the nurture side of nature and that's really an untold story it's an uncomfortable story because it sounds like someone we might want to make heroes out of some of the twisting of science in the soviet union but nonetheless there are these interesting complexities and what's amazing about nazi sciences is how there was this collaboration and you're talking about a culture where they're inventing things like electron microscopy they're doing all kinds of studies in anthropology so a lot of that's an untold story so what was the connection between the ideology and the science if you can just linger on it longer well we tend to think of science and ideology as completely separate when i think the reality is there is there not if you look at why the mayans in the 7th and 8th century a.d had the world's most accurate calendar accurate to within 17 seconds per year that was all part of a ritual practice to celebrate the rise of kukulkan the rise of the of venus with what's called the heliacal rise rising namely the rising of venus before the rising of the sun in which which at which moment venus is destroyed by the light of the sun well they developed this elaborate calendrical astronomy which required detailed observation detailed chronicling of movement of the heavens in particular the planets for the purpose of celebrating this cycle of renewal that they thought was sacred and and uh holy and magical so where's the ideology where's the science there's the the sort of instrumentation the calendrics the measure the measurement all in the service of this magical moment and i think that's true of a lot of science i had a friend years ago who was mennonite and wanted to study solar cells and to improve silicon chips to make more efficient solar energy there was no money for that when ronald reagan took office the budgets for solar and alternative energy were essentially zeroed out and reagan takes off the solar panels off of the roof of the white house so my friend end up ends up working on hardening silicon chips against nuclear war so he becomes part of the nuclear war protection defense apparatus even though he wanted to work on alternative energy doing very similar work with silicon chips but in a different framework and so the practice of science often gets pushed into and is is woven into ideological practices and sort of in the same way that you get beautiful um medieval cathedrals built uh in service of of catholicism well what's in the mind of an individual scientist so this this process of ideology polluting science or is it science empowering ideology so almost like uh if you can zoom in and zoom out effortlessly into the individual mind of a scientist then back to the whole scientific community like do scientists think about nuclear war about the atrocities committed by the nazis as they're helping on the minute details of the scientific process i think sometimes they do and sometimes they don't right you think of the chemists working to develop the cyanide that will be used to kill jews that uh in a concentration camp what are they thinking you can imagine a whole range of thoughts maybe they don't know what they're doing maybe they do maybe they know a little bit but not a lot maybe they don't want to know maybe they have ways of of lying to themselves maybe they are the one person who agreed to do it in 99 refused so you know it's hard if not impossible to know what's in the soul of anyone but when you have enormous power directing the motion and the currents or the ocean it's not hard to find people willing to fill that in especially if they're narrow technocrats you know if they're just doing their job if they're just building the widget and i think a lot of scientific training is in widget widget building and that leads to the possibility that they can become easily instrumentalized in a particular in a particular action which is maybe horrific or or glorious the other thing to keep in mind is that sciences as we say what scientists do and that can include a lot of things that can exclude a lot of things the word science itself is interesting because it's cognate it actually comes originally from the proto-indo-european uh skein meaning to cut or divide and so it's cognate with scissors schism skin skin is that which divides you from the world shit or scat is that which has been divided from you into the world and so there's this cognate uh between science and shit or science and cutting with the whole idea being that you're dividing into parts classifying it's the taxonomic impulse and to know is to know where something belongs to divide it into its parts and put it in its proper place and that taxonomic impulse can be very static it's actually one of the things that darwin had to overcome in recognizing evolution that the taxonomies are in motion um but it also can lead to a kind of myopia that my job is done when i've classified something is is is this bird an x a y or a z and that again can be it can be ideological or it cannot be but scientists are humans humans and they're fitting in with a world with a world practice and that's that's that's limiting it's kind of inevitable it's unavoidable it's hard to be if not impossible out of the world that we're that we're walking in yeah and it's fascinating because i think ideologies also have an impulse towards forming taxonomies and there is um so just uh so uh being at mit i've gotten to learn about this character named jeffrey epstein i didn't know who this was until all the news broke out and so on and it started to wonder how did all these people at mit that i admire would hang out with this person just lightly just have conversations i don't mean any of the bigger things but even just basic conversations and i think this has to do you said scientists are widget builders and taxonomizers i think there's power in somebody like the nazi regime or like a jeffrey epstein just being excited about your widgets and making you feel like the widget serves a greater purpose in the world and so it's not like you're um you know some sometimes people say scientists want to make money and uh or they have a big kind of ideological drive behind it i think there's just nice one the widgets you like building anyway somehow somebody convinces you some charismatic person that this widget is actually has a grander purpose and you don't almost feel think about the negative or whether it's positive just the fact that it's grand is already super exciting yeah yeah i think that's right i think that's the story of vernafun brown you know and the fascination with rockets and this will you know enlarge something in the world and here he is he's an ss officer he's working around slave labor uh and then but his rocket then gets compressed into the the western world or the american world and basically launches us to the moon and we forget about the sauce how the sausage was made uh originally what can you talk about him a little bit more because he's such a fascinating character because he so he's he was a nazi but he was also an american and it had such a grand impact on on both and like there's this uncomfortable fact that he's you know one of the central figures that gave birth to the american space exploration efforts yeah he's an interesting figure fascinated in a kind of a tunnel vision way with space flight he made these beautiful rockets already beginning in the 20s early 30s ends up for a while at panamunda using slave labor to build v2 engines and and so forth like that i remember going to pennamunda where people have actually tracked the flights of aborted v2 rockets and found some of these beautiful beautiful old engines just the most like works of art these these engines used to rain terror uh on on the british it's interesting because in that same spot i was hunting for amber baltic amber because i'm a stone collector and among the amber collectors there there's a famous story of the the panama to burn it's called because they find yellow phosphorus they think it's amber they put it in their pocket and then it dries out and then explodes and creates this big burn uh burn on their legs but the whole nazi regime is is full of things like that it's full of these scholars who get twisted into a mindset and uh it's also important to realize that people didn't often see what was coming and we look back and we say how could you x y or z but before the holocaust there's not the holocaust uh there are versions of it but things get on a new meaning gain a new meaning in light of subsequent events and there's a entire propaganda machine that makes it easier for you to to to hold the narrative in your head even if you kind of intuitively know there's something really wrong here because of the propaganda you can kind of convince yourself to be able to sleep at night that's right and we have to remember that gerbil's office was not the office of propaganda it was the office of enlightenment of popular enlightenment and propaganda so enlightenment enlightenment was part of his just the new era of enlightenment from his perspective it was supposed to be the new age the new era of enlightenment it's a little bit like the the kind of myth of hitler's failed artist and you know his art is not that bad you know there are a lot of artists who are who are worse and i had a very interesting conversation once with my my college roommate who became a librarian at harvard and at harvard he met an old old librarian a german woman who had met hitler as a kid when she was like eight years old her dad was like a gal lighter for the nuremberg area and she said that for 15 minutes hitler goes out onto the balcony with her and has this conversation alone with this you know eight-year-old girl and she said he was charming and funny and then he said he loved kids and she she said he was the most you know charming sort of person and that's part of the history too that we tend to forget when we make a scarecrow image of this rabid raging fanatic you know that's there's more to it than that that's really really really important to think about when we make a scarecrow because that gives you actionable like it it forces you to introspect about people in your own life or leaders in your life today ones you admire they're charismatic they're friendly they love kids they they talk about enlightenment you have to kind of think all right am i being duped on certain things you have to kind of have a i mean that's the problem with jeffrey epstein that people don't seem to talk about i don't i i never met the guy but just given the people he talked to whom i know it feels like he must have been charismatic yeah like people think about like oh it's because of the women it's because of the money uh i don't the people i know i don't think they're going to be influenced ultimately it has to be how you are in the room and make it's it's exactly like you said the enlightenment i think that excites the the scientists of course as a charismatic person you have to know what to pick in terms of what excites you but that that is also the fascinating thing to me about hitler is all of these meetings even like with chamberlain inside rooms whether he was screaming or whatever he was saying it seems like he was very convincing there must have been passion in his eyes there must have been charisma that one-on-one in a quiet conversation he was convincing yes there's a famous story about gerbils who would do a party trick where for 15 minutes for 15 minutes he would rouse the crowd to communism workers of the world unite then for 15 minutes he would rouse the world to capitalism yeah and individualism and then for 15 minutes he would rouse the world to nazism and apparently he was quite convincing in each of those performances well all those ideologies are pretty powerful i mean they and i think it's not even the the reason that matters as much as the power of the dream of the vision of the enlightenment i mean the vision of communism is fascinatingly powerful yeah like workers unite the the common people stand together they'll overthrow the powerful the greedy yeah and yeah share the the outcomes of our hard work yeah well it's kind of like the fan the story of the two-thirds of the things that marx calls for in the communist manifesto are already just part of the liberal state and so the parts we remember or forget about an ideology are very revealing if we can just linger on this a little bit longer what have you learned from this period of the nineteen about the scientific process so one of the labels you can put on your work and you as a scholar is a philosopher of science and you also talk about nazi germany as a singular moment in time or like a a rebirth of the integration between ideology and science so the like um in terms of valueless science i think is the term value freestyle value free science uh that you use i mean it seems like nazi germany is a important moment in history i mean it probably goes up and down what what um difficult truths have you learned about the scientific process and what hopeful things have you learned about the scientific process well i guess the saddening thing is how easily people can become part of a machine uh if there's power people can be found to follow it you know one of the things i work on is is big tobacco and we'll probably come to that but it's amazing to me how easily people are willing to work for big tobacco it's amazing to me how many scientists and physicians were willing to work for the nazi regime for multiple reasons partly because a lot of them really thought they were you know doing the lord's work they thought they were cleaning the world of filth you know i mean if you really thought you know jews are a parasitic race you know why wouldn't you you know get rid of them so there's an ontology there's there's a theory of the world that they're building on and interestingly one that was um also present in the united states and one of the things i did find out in my earliest research was that the nazis had looked lovingly and enviously over at the united states in terms of racial segregation racial separation and saw themselves in a kind of competition to become the world's racial leader as the most purified racial form and that this required this kind of cleansing process and the cleansing meant getting rid of the physically handicapped it meaning getting rid of racial inferiors as they imagined them it meant uh getting rid of cancer-causing chemicals in the air and in our food and our water these were all of a piece uh there's a famous uh illustration that richard dahl talks about the great great cancer theorists of of of studying in nazi germany in the in the 1930s and he's shown a lecture where cancer cells are shown as jews and x-rays are shown as a stormtroopers and these stormtroopers are killing the the cancer cells who are also jews and so there's this metaphorical work of of cleaning extermination sanitation purification of the sort purification there's definitely a kind of purity quest and you see that at multiple levels and so you see how easy it is for people to fall into that given a particular theory and again coming back to that earlier sort of point about the scarecrow which i think is very important uh if we imagine that nothing like this went on here in the united states that would be a big mistake the the nazis are looking to the save the redwoods league to their uh you know to the the aryan supremacists to the ku klux klan to the to the uh separation of blacks and whites blacks were not allowed to join the american medical association until after world war ii so you have racial segregation you have massive sterilization in the united states way before the nazis one of the first things the nazis do from a racial hygiene point of view is start sterilizing what they call the mentally ill and the physically handicapped well that had been going on since around world war one in the united states and even earlier in certain states in the form of castration of of prisoners in order to prevent their demon seed from being propagated further into the race so there's a kind of a racial international that's going on and that part of the story also needs to be told and scientists were able to carry those ideas in their mind from from your work of course of course i mean that's one of the things going on with all the renaming of buildings now uh is scientists who were eugenesis are now getting their names pulled off of buildings my personal view is that it has to be done on a case-by-case basis but in general i think it's it's usually better to add on rather than subtract in other words to add history rather than erase history or pretend as if history had never existed let me let me give you a specific example of that uh one of the most powerful and diabolical university presidents in the nazi period was a guy named carl astell a-s-t-e-l and he was a rabid nazi high up in the leadership and in his portrait at the university of vienna there he is in full ss uniform that painting was taken down now what i would have done is left the painting and put a you know add a plaque yeah but to pretend as if that never happened or to erase history in that way i think is is a big big mistake can't look at that point so i haven't gotten through it yet but i've been trying to get to minecomp and you know throughout his history has been taken down and up it actually was taken down from amazon for a while recently what can you say about keeping that stuff up so the reason it was taken down from amazon i mean there's there's a large number of people that will read that and um the hate in their heart will grow so they're not using it for educational purposes you can't put a plaque on the mine comp you're ruining mineconf then like you can't i mean this is you know amazon can't do a warning saying like um so it still just stands on its own yeah i mean it's uh not well written so you can maybe convince yourself that it's okay because it's not well written so it's not it's not like this inspiring book of ideology that could easily convince but uh can you steal man the argument that my column should be banned and can you steal man the argument that it should be not banned well i wouldn't say it should be banned i think if anything that might make it forbidden fruit now this might be different when we come to statues on the public square after world war ii the statues of hitler there must have been thousands of them were taken down now i think even the most rabid opponents of cancel culture would not say there was something wrong with taking down the statues of hitler that were in every office building every post office so i think a lot depends on the placement and the purpose of icons of statues of text i don't see the harm in being able to buy mineconf it it's so out of this world and now by now just the language and uh if anything there probably is more good done by people being shocked at how dumb it is than the evil that might be done by someone reading it i i can't imagine people being really gripped by that now partly just because it's kind of outdated and crazy crazy talk so in that case i would not be uh in favor of that when it comes to monuments or other types of things it's a judgment call in each case i think it has to be probably voted on but it also uh i think in many of these cases there's an add-on view it would fix a lot of the problems we'll jump around a little bit we'll come back to uh medicine and uh war on cancer but let me just add one thing on and recently the the name of uh macmillan who works on the charge of the electron in early part of the 20th century his name was taken off of a building at caltech well to take his name off what do you really do it wasn't a central aspect of his actual work it's not why he was put on the the name of that building at caltech and also the memory is lost and the lesson is lost when you could have kept the macmillan name on the building and added a plaque you know this guy was a racist or this guy was a eugenicist or some something to make a teaching moment instead of just a forgetting moment yeah well let me take a small tangent and ask you about censorship and this particular period we're living through so my friend joe rogan has a podcast he hosts a few folks on there and they they're folks of differing opinions and as we speak there's kind of a battle going on over whether joe rogan should be on spotify and allowed to spread scientific misinformation in particular there's a guy named robert malone that's talking about that that's making a case against of at least against the covet vaccine and so on so outside of the specifics of this person in this battle of scientific ideas that are sometimes tied up with ideology in our modern world what do you think is the role like who gets the sensor decide what is misinformation or information should we let ideas fly in the scientific realms of scientific ideas or should we try to get it under control like what which way obviously all uh approaches will go wrong in some ways which is more likely to go wrong uh one where you try to get a hold of like all right this is a viral thing and it doesn't fit with scientific consensus so we should probably like try to like quiet it down a little bit or do you let it all just fly and let the ideas battle do you think about this kind of stuff in the context of of uh history well that used to be a million dollar question of course now it's a multi-billion dollar question not trillion yeah um we're talking about powerful internet platforms becoming essentially publishers and publishers can't say whatever they want there are limits uh there's you know they can't yell fire in a crowded theater but there are uh there's a kind of social responsibility that is there and i know some of these i don't know a lot about this topic but i know there are large some of the large platforms do have dedicated offices to trying to rein in misinformation as you would expect any publisher to do you can't just let anything fly in time magazine or or the new york times either they have they're all kinds of codes of ethics and legal obligations so i uh i'm a fan of the efforts or i think some of the large internet platforms should be congratulated at least for trying to make an effort to rein in misinformation it's going to be difficult and there the mistakes are going to be made but it can't be a let everything fly kind of situation but when i watch unfortunately the pressure these platforms feel to identify and to censor misinformation that pressure is uh ideological in nature currently so if you just objectively look there's a certain political lien to people that are pressing on the censorship of the misinformation which makes me very uncomfortable because now there's an ideology to labeling something as misinformation as opposed to kind of uh having a you know value less evaluation of what is true or not and and you also have to acknowledge that it says something that there's a very large number of people that um for example follow robert malone or follow people i mean what does that say about society yeah and that there's a deeper lesson in there that's not just about blocking misinformation it's uh distrust in science and institutions distrusting leaders like it feels like you have to fix that and censorship of misinformation is not going to be fixing that it's only going to like throw gasoline on the fire you got to put out the fire well that's that's certainly possible yeah i mean the uh i think people are distrustful of certain institutions and not others right and uh i think a lot of distrust is is good uh i'm not a conspiracy theorist but i do know there have been a lot of conspiracies and that you know people work behind scenes to do powerful bad things and that's what needs to be exposed the other thing i worry about which is relevant to your question again it's a billion or trillion dollar question is uh we're ki i think in a world of kind of flattening where all news or all information or all data is kind of equal in some way and so you get the twitter verse going and it doesn't matter if it's peer-reviewed or it doesn't matter if it's been supported by evidence it's just you know a kind of outburst it's it's interesting to contrast it with say a hundred years ago i mean what would a crazy person or a uh a flat earther or anything what venue would they have i mean maybe they could go to a church or someplace i mean uh so now we have this in these empowering engines then that's what's new historically is that basically anyone can have a blog or a twitter feed and that is new and so that is you can think of it also as a kind of clutter so it's kind of a radical democracy in a way that kind of the one of the weaknesses of democracy is if everyone has an equal voice and if everyone has equal power so there's of course a flip side to that where everyone has equal power it forces the people who are quote-unquote experts to be better communication i think people like scientists are just like upset that they have to do like better work at communicating now they used to be lazy and you could just like say i have a phd therefore everyone listen to me now they have to actually convince people like you have to convince people that the earth is round you can't just say the earth is wrong that's it you have to like show you have to uh make like i mean not the earth is round part but things like that you have to actually be a great communicator and great do great lectures do documentaries and so on and to battle those ideas and then also to defend the sort of uh the people labeled as crazy you know in nazi germany if you were protesting against uh some of the uses of science of medicine to commit atrocities you would also be labeled crazy yeah so well those voices are important yeah there's so many good points there the on the scientists becoming good communicators the history of scientists becoming bad communicators has a history and the last original contribution to science written entirely in the form of a poem is buu bufol's loves of the plants and following that in the 18th century you get the uglification of science the deliberate uglification of science with the idea being that if you are clear and if you speak beautifully if you write beautifully you're hiding something you're covering over the truth with flowers and decorations and and scents and pleasant odors and so you get this scientific paper format you know introduction discussion methods conclude you know results conclusions and it's it's kind of policed in this inhumane non-humanistic kind of rhetorical way and that's a big problem and so you get that combined with just the rise of the research lab and the ever narrower uh widget builders the cogs and the machine it's not surprising that people might not trust certain aspects of that that combined with the dirty laundry history of a lot of science uh that you did have you know the requirement that uh at auschwitz that people be you know that physicians supervise the killings uh you know the the horrors of you know tuskegee and and all kinds of other things or even something like the atom bomb which is arguably more neutral at least but nonetheless horrific and so it's not surprising that a lot of people don't trust science and a lot of science shouldn't be trusted right there's science and then there's science so there's a long history of dirty bad science that you don't solve just by saying we should have trusted it let's just stay uncovered for a brief moment and talk about a particular leader that i think about is anthony fauci i've thought about whether to talk to him or not i have my own feelings about anthony fauci by the way i'm you know i admire basically everybody and i admire scientists a lot and there's something about him that bothers me i think because i'm always bothered by ego and lack of humility and i sense that maybe maybe i'm very wrong on this but so he said that he represents science if you've taken in full context i understand the point he's making which is you know when people attack um attack him they think of him as representing science things like that but there's ego in that and what do you think motivates and informs his decisions is it politics or science and the broader question i have what does it take to be a great scientific leader in difficult times like these and maybe you could say nazi germany was similar when there's obviously like you like anthony fauci just like scientific leaders during nazi germany could have made a difference it feels like uh positive and negative and so it's like there's a lot of stake uh there's a lot at stake in terms of scientific leadership if i've asked about 17 questions if there's something worthwhile answering in that well fauci i think is doing as as good as job as he can i mean he's a you can't turn on the television without seeing him um but no that's what's the goal of the job that means he appears a lot but there's uh he does not come off as somebody who with authenticity like i admire so many science communicators about 10x 100x more than him including his boss francis collins who have i recently lost respect for given some of the emails that leaked there's ego in those emails yeah and it upsets me because like i i hope all that stuff comes out and wakes young scientists up to don't be a douchebag don't don't be humble be honest be authentic be real put yourself out there don't play the pr game don't play politics just get excited about the widget building that you love communicate that and think about the difficult ethical questions there and communicate them be transparent don't think like the public don't talk down to the public don't think the public is too dumb to understand the complexities involved because the moment you start to think that when you're like 30 what do you think happens when you're 40 and 50 the slippery slope of that the ego builds the this like this uh the distaste for the public opinion builds and then then you get into the leadership position at the time you're 60 and 70 and then you're just a dick and you're a bad communicator to the very public so i think i think this is something that just builds over time is the skill to communicate to be honest to be real to constantly humble yourself to surround yourself with people that that humble you anyway i i i'm i'm bothered by it because i feel like science is under attack uh people distrust science more and more and more yeah and uh it is perhaps unfair to put place like anthony fauci to blame for that but you know what leaders take take care of the responsibility so when you're saying that he's um doing the best job he can i would say he's doing a reasonable job but not the best job he can yeah well i don't know what his capabilities are on that i mean like one time or the other right like what like you can imagine how history sees great leaders that unite on which history turns that's not a great leader because there's a huge division that there's a lot of people there's a lot of people in leadership position that can heal the division you can you can think of tech leaders they can heal the division because they have the platform they can speak out with eloquence you can think of political leaders presidents that can speak out and heal the division you could think of scientific leaders like anthony fauci they could heal division none of these are doing a good job right now and which is you know leadership is hard which is why when great leaders come along history remembers them so i just want to point out the emperor has no clothes when the leaders are like eh the kind of mediocre yeah because it feels like not i guess i'll take it to a question about nazi germany what is the heroic action for a scientist in nazi germany like to stand to see what's right when uh you're under this cloud of ideology yeah well it's an almost impossible task in nazi germany uh maybe the heroic task would have been before uh hitler was essentially elected uh and the reichstag is burned so in the 30s because it's building when it's building uh what the other alternatives are um maybe it's events in in world war one that that could have made nazism less inevitable um you know maybe it's uh going back in to the british empire which had a giant empire and and germany wanted a big empire too right and that part of the history of world war one is is often often forgotten so you know the heroic act is is to stand up and tell the truth and fight against evil and of course you can get oh science interrupt but of course you have some courage you know but i also so i i personally don't always have complete respect of people who stand up and have courage because it's not often effective i what i what i have the most respect for is uh long-term courage like that's effective because like you know if you're just an activist and you speak out this is wrong that's not gonna be effective because everybody around you is uh saying nah it's like we like our widgets yeah so you have to somehow like steer this titanic ship yeah and i guess you're right the easiest way to stare is to do it earlier well everyone has different skills um you know musk is building electric cars and [Music] other people are trying to you know build solar and wind and there are all kinds of problems that we're going to solve right people are building better vaccines you know there's a thousand ways to do good in the world and the thousand ways to do bad in the world i mean part of the problem in science is that we don't look enough at what i call the causes of causes so cigarettes cause cancer but what causes cigarettes yeah so the deeper yeah yeah so obesity causes heart disease but what causes obesity and it's not just gluttony and sloth it's it's the decision to pump up the sugar industry and to allow soda in school and i'm a big fan of loot what i call loop closing um we're all worried about climate change and reducing our carbon footprint but what about the hidden causes the unprobed causes i'm doing a project now with london shebinger on looking at how voluntary family planning could actually have a big role in reducing carbon footprint throughout the world and these literatures are never joined or rarely joined that we have this huge um carbon emissions problem but we also have you know too many people on the planet and the cause of that is because too few women and men have access to birth control and if you join those realms open there's going to be new possibilities uh and that's it's kind of like looking at uh uh the flip side of fascism and the kind of things the discoveries they made that have been ignored that's one of the things i'm interested in is finding some of the gaping holes the ideological gaps that have been ignored because of ideology left or right by the way all both of which are involve blinders and so there's all kinds of blinders that we live in that's part of ideology is what what don't we even see and that would uh prevent us from seeing some deep objective scientific truth right some truth and there's actually so just to mention there's some people including elon who are saying um there's not too many people there's not enough people right that if you just look at the birth rates it's and so it's like some of this is actually very difficult to figure out because that there's there's these narratives you mentioned tobacco obesity with sugar there's been narratives throughout the history and it's very um there are certain topics on which it's um easy to almost become apathetic which because like you just see in history how narratives take hold and fade away you know people were really sure what that tobacco is is not at all a problem and then it fades and then they figure it out and then other things come along what other things came along now you know well you asked about ideology and one of the things i always ask students before class whether i'm teaching magnetology or world history of sciences what makes fish move and 90 of americans will say some version of mussels fins you know neurons when the reality is at least in salt water fish don't swim places they're moved by currents fish are moved by currents that's what makes fish move this is not even counting the rotation of the earth on its axis sort of the rotation of the earth around the sun or the rotation of the solar system around the galaxy you know ignore all that even on earth fish arrive up in alaska they didn't they don't swim there they come by currents and this is known to people who understand the ecology of of of fish but we as sort of individualistic americans think that the fish pulled itself up by his booster holds itself up by his bootstraps right and whatever you know gumption and and uh courage you know made his own world instead of thinking of something like cigarettes for example hitting a village like an epidemic hitting the village like cholera or pneumonia or something like that so there's a big ideology we have of personal choice a great example of that is in in the tobacco world where people always there's a whole field called cessation that always means cessation of consumption never cessation of production all blame is put on the individual smoker instead of looking at how they get smoked and looking at that bigger picture i think is is is part of the story so a few years ago you wrote that the cigarette is the deadliest object in the history of human civilization cigarettes kill about 6 million people every year a number that will grow before it shrinks smoking in the 20th century killed 100 million people and a billion could perish in our century unless we reversed the course can you explain this idea that it's the deadliest object in the history of human civilization maybe just also talk about big tobacco and your efforts there well cigarettes have killed more than any other object and all the world of iron all the world of gunpowder nuclear bombs have only killed a few hundred thousand people cigarettes have killed hundreds of millions and every year kill about as many as kovit they're they're sort of neck and neck but if you took the last five years there's no contest cigarettes have killed far more and are far more preventable so we're in a world this bizarro world where every night there's a covid report and cigarettes would never be mentioned cigarettes would no more likely to be mentioned than if we were talking about chewing gum on a sidewalk they'd be no more likely to be in a presidential debate than you know uh sneezing in the wrong place so we live in this world where most things are invisible you know we we are the eyes are in the front of the head we don't see what's behind us we have a fovea which means not only do we only see what's in front of us we see in a very narrow tunnel and that's because we're predators we don't have the eternal watchfulness of prey we have a zeroed targeted focus and that leads to a kind of myopia or a tunnel vision and all kinds of things then when you get something like a very powerful tobacco industry which is a multi-multi-billion dollar industry which still spends many billions of dollars advertising every year but nonetheless manages to make themselves invisible you have this powerful agent that is producing producing this engine of death that is invisible it's been reduced to the fish that move themselves in other words there's not really a tobacco industry there's just people who smoke and that's a personal choice like what food we're going to have for dinner tonight and so it's erased from the policy world it's as if it doesn't exist and creating that sense of invisibility to failure to understand the causes of causes is what allows the epidemic to continue but also not even to be acknowledged how's the invisibility created is it natural is it just human nature that ideas just fade from our attention or is it malevolent still going on kind of um action by the tobacco companies to keep this invisible it's still going on even when you see an ad against cigarettes on television that's dramatically curtailed because the law that made those even possible required that there be there's an anti-villainy clause the industry can't be made in even visible in those ads and some they get away with it but the industry operates through very powerful agents you know powerful senators they used to count three quarters of the members of of congress as you know grade-a contacts they had most of the senators in their pocket a lot of the senators sometimes they'll play both sides of the aisle basically tobacco is democratic democratic party until basically the 70s and ronald reagan then it shifts over to becoming republican they create bodies like the tea party they merged with big oil the koch brothers in the 1980s and 90s to form the tea party and a whole series of fronts which fight against all regulation and all taxation in order to prevent gas taxes and cigarette taxes which are bonded in the convenience store in walmart most cigarettes are actually sold in places like walmart and pharmacies and 7-elevens things like that and through that locus then you have gasoline and tobacco sort of in this micro architectural collaboration uh so there's multiple multiple means that they use plus a lot of their targeting is is hyper-specific they use the internet very effectively they use email and thing that are customer targeting what goes to the mind of a big tobacco executive this is connecting to our previous conversations of scientists and so on i always wonder about that i talked to pfizer ceo for example and there's a deep question with the pfizer ceo with with i i guess any ceo but big pharma would you it's like if you can come up with a cure that gets rid of the problem that's in the big pharma would you want to because you're going to lose a lot of money once the cure fixes the problem it's nice to like there's so many incentives to make money can you think clearly and make the right decisions i'd like to believe most people are good and um it's almost like this steve jobs idea just like do the right thing and you'll make money in the end it's like long term you'll make a lot of money if you do the right action because there's always going to be problems you can fix you can always pivot the company to focus on other things as long as you're doing the best innovation the best science the best development and the production and deployment and stuff you're going to win but there's another view where you might um that kind of idea of making money pollution is the widget building it is exciting when you can release a product that makes a lot of money and you start enjoying the charts that say the money is going up and you stop thinking about maybe there's the that's the wrong choice for human civilization well one of the reasons i was made a courtesy appointment in pulmonary medicine at stanford was they recognized i was doing more to save lives by trying to stop big tobacco than they were by yanking out this long that long you know on a daily basis cause of causes the cause of causes which i which we can keep returning to your question about how do people live with themselves is a crucial one and it's one i've thought about a lot it's one you think about with in in any context of horror how do people live with themselves how do they get up in the morning i think there's a lot of incentives one thing that you have to keep in mind is that whoever becomes ceo of a big tobacco company they have already made decisions along the way and they are the remnant of a whole series of aspiring people who want to climb the ladder of success who maybe would refuse yeah something like this but those don't survive the journey those survive the journey who be who can make it through and and i think they have a mixture of ideologies one they'll say well if i didn't do it someone else would this is kind of the pour the cyclone be down the chimney into auschwitz well if i didn't do it someone else would so what's really the difference between me doing and someone else so that's one view another one is the tobacco industry i think really doesn't like their customers except for the fact that they like their their money when you look at their documents they talk about target targeting against young adults or against women or against uh homosexuals there's a whole project reynolds has called project scum which is project subculture urban markets where they're targeting homeless and homosexuals in san francisco so what kind of business model regards their customers as as scum or talks about them uh as as as one famous reynolds executives you know we don't smoke this stuff we reserve that for the poor the black and the stupid that's a direct quote uh from one of the winston models so it's a company culture that sees the customers almost like as the enemy or like uh or worthless losers losers you know so you have these executives you know if we don't do it someone else will if people are dumb enough to buy our product right let them buy it maybe it's a personal choice maybe they're libertarians maybe they're just as you said seduced by the money and the money is enormous the money is enormous and these these the you know tobacco executives make tens of millions of dollars per year just in their salaries um i so i think there's a whole series of of logics some at some point some of the companies have become food producers in the 1980s and 90s philip morris which uh makes marlboro was the largest food producer in the united states and so they could say well we're producing many products many addictive desirable desirable products i think one project i'm working on now actually is looking at how the industry maintains morale in their own workforce and they create a kind of parallel world of prizes and rewards and tobacco queens and tobacco princesses and tobacco sports teams and tobacco it's this whole separate world a world within a world and we all live in bubbles of a sort and so there is this kind of tobacco world where you're with us or you're against us and i even found evidence that the tobacco industry lies to its own employees so they censored their own employee information so that everyone would be on board that well maybe it doesn't really cause cancer the evidence is all statistics can't trust mice experiments because mice are not men they hire the guy daryl huff who wrote how to lie with statistics the best-selling statistics book in the history of the world they paid him to write a book called how to lie about smoking with statistics now that was never published when when sort of word of some other dirty tricks got out so one way they're able to gain legitimacy gain normalcy gain you know these are supporters of the arts you know there are universities named for tobacco executives you know we have duke university and we have the george weissman school i think is of arts and sciences at cuny and there are prizes you know philip morris essentially created women's tennis as a spectator sport billie jean king joins the board of directors of philip morris she signs coupons the two to one coupons for buying virginia slim cigarettes so the industry is able to acquire this talent and then through a kind of a an application of causality purely into the individual smoker if you smoke you did it to yourself and so in a sense we have nothing to do with it it's sort of the same argument exxon is making now with uh carbon it's like well we just make the gas we don't burn the gas so really we're not the problem it's it's whoever drove here in a car that burned gas and so there's a very interesting question how who who is liable who is responsible for is the manufacturer just immune because it's a legal product and people make the foolish decision to smoke or does the addiction play a role in the liability so these are all really interesting legal questions and philosophical questions where do you attribute the success in the fight against big tobacco so i mean there's been a lot of progress made maybe two questions one is that and two how much more is to be done well there's been in my view not that much progress to the tobacco industry basically won the war against cigarettes in the 1950s the broader assumption inside and outside the industry would be what was that if tobacco if cigarettes are ever shown as causing cancer obviously they'll be banned the famous slogan in the 50s was if if spinach were ever shown to cause one-tenth the harm of cigarettes it would be banned overnight flash forward you know 50 years we still have [Music] we still have 200 some billion cigarettes smoked in the united states every year globally we still have about six trillion cigarettes smoked every year that's 350 million miles of cigarettes smoked every year that's enough to go to make a continuous chain of cigarettes from the earth to the sun and back was enough left over for several round trips to mars but it's much fewer than before i mean okay so culturally speaking i grew up in soviet union uh everybody smoked everybody smoked well by everybody you mean about half well by everybody i mean culturally so so what does it feel like when everybody smokes right what percentage is that right now in the united states it feels like nobody smokes feel i'm talking about culturally do you see uh famous actors and actresses do you see movies all the time you do you can't watch a hollywood movie without pretty pretty much continuous smoking but i mean look at peaky blinders look at uh you know in any of the modern series now it's pretty much a one non-stop you're right there has been a change i mean that that's true the the purest metric in the united states is number of cigarettes smoked per year and that peaks in 1981 at 640 billion cigarettes wow that's declined now to the level it was in 1940 which is about 240 billion cigarettes wow now globally the number has increased see but but the perception and sorry to interrupt but the that's interesting even in the united states the numbers the decrease is not as significant as i thought it is because just in my own experience with people you know people speak negatively about smoking yeah well for one thing smokers do i mean smokers hate the fact they smoke right so this is the interesting observation i'm speaking to is uh even the smokers are talking negatively about smoking but they're still smoking so even though i'm seeing this shift where smoking is no longer the cool thing where it's uh like when i was growing up and i smoked for a time it was like a way to bond with strangers to uh to talk to you share a moment and share a moment together i mean it's a beautiful thing and it it's it's interesting because we need to find other ways to share moments uh but you know you bum you almost smoke from a stranger i mean that was seen as a good thing now did you ever smoke oh you did yeah for how many years uh two years i was in music so what happened is i was a musician i was in a band well there you go and no there is a bonding aspect to it and i think i stopped smoking when they uh banned um smoking inside bars yeah exactly which was uh i mean that was i mean looking back now it seems it's such a powerful move i mean maybe you can speak to that because that was one of the moments that woke me up wait a minute like um that was a big shift for me and i'm sure i'm not alone where it's not just like it forced me to rethink the the effect of smoking has on me yes and also to think can i actually live a life without smoking can i um you know some people have that i haven't i haven't gone through that process yet but some people have that with drinking yeah can i have fun without drinking um i think the answer to that is yes but i'm still drinking [Music] so that that's a big shift for example if they ban drinking at certain places and there's a lot of negative things to say about alcohol well i'm i'm older than you and i remember when mother and i think you weren't even in the in this country then but there was something called mothers against drunk driving and if you look at movies from the 50s 60s even 70s being drunk was just kind of a funny thing yeah and you would drive drunk what's the big deal really and mothers against drunk driving really denormalized drinking and driving much like seat belts when i was a kid you know there were no seat belts you just lie in the back of the car and you drove out west with your with your parents and you'd lie flat it was wonderful seat belts come along and now it's pretty normalized that you buckle up it's pretty normalized that you don't drink and so the moment you identify is is absolutely crucially important a lot of it started in california where there were bands on on cigarettes some of it actually started in the computer industry because some of the early bugs that were found on tapes in the 70s were caused by smoke and some of the earliest indoor smoking bans were actually in computer rooms which were supposed to be clean enough that the tapes wouldn't spin and get caught by some snag of soot and the workers started saying wait a minute if if the smoke can hurt the tapes can it hurt my lungs as well and so some of these early laws already in the late 70s early 80s pushing it out was a huge struggle the tobacco industry marshaled an army of experts to say that second-hand smoke is an entirely different kind of smoke it can't hurt you they eventually lost that battle and now we have so-called smoke-free laws where you can't smoke in most workplaces in most restaurants and that denormalization has been crucial because remember aristotle says tell me who you walk with and i'll tell you who you are and if your friends are smoking if your friends are doing whatever it it makes it easier the tobacco industry has been a genius at manipulating and really creating the material culture of the modern world if your shirt has a pocket that's to fit cigarettes right if your car has a has a plug in every car that i used to have had a cigarette lighter it had an ashtray every plane that i flew when i was a kid when i was younger anyway there was smoking on it originally and then there were ashtrays and even today every plane by law has to have ashtrays in the bathrooms because people still smoke in the planes there's a special technique they have where they go in and light up your cigarette and put your mouth right down in the middle of the toilet and then flush it right at that same moment and that's why they're i think it's a good big puff puff and flush it and to prevent people from bringing down the plane by putting the cigarette out in the trash every plane must have ashtrays so that tells you something about the power of addiction the power of normalcy and it's related to your question of this this crucial moment if you can no longer smoke in a bar if you can no longer smell and by the way that's different from drinking most people who smoke wish they didn't most people to drink that's not true most people who drink they don't wish there are some addicts you know five percent we say but you're talking about 70 80 90 of people who smoke cigarettes regularly or wish they did not and that's actually where i learned about uh the idea that we could get rid of cigarettes entirely was just from talking to ordinary smokers those are the people who are willing to say you know let's let's get let's get cigarettes all together and get rid of them all together because it's not a recreational drug it's very different from alcohol and the genius of of the alc of the tobacco industry is to turn basic to trivialize addiction into just something we all like it's addictive i like it and also to say that basically smoking is like drinking which in fact it's not alcohol tends to be a recreational drug and cigarettes are more like heroin so how do we get that 200 billion down closer to zero well the good news and i know you like good news and i i do too is that every year we have about eight billion fewer cigarettes smoked in the united states so we're going in the right direction we're going to solve this you know they're not every problem you can solve in the world this is a very solvable problem it's an enormous problem arguably as big as covid in certain respects much more invisible than covet but very solvable and actually will be solved probably because of of climate change because we're going to need to find ways to reduce carbon footprints across the board and that's going to be a a kind of uh cultural revolution of sorts once we have a category 6 hurricane and you know hundreds of thousands of people start dying from the storms that are coming but we'll be it's like that metaphor of you know there there's a uh a sci-fi film from 1950 where they're trying to uh get back to earth from the moon and uh they have to jettison their toolbox and their ladder and this and this and this that's sort of i think what the world we're going to be and we're going to have to jettison a lot of things and cigarettes will be one of the things we can get rid of let's come back to nazi germany for a time you uh also wrote the book titled the nazi war on cancer right what is the main storyline and thesis of this book well i had been researching nazi medicine i went over to germany i didn't know what i wanted to do i got a fulbright i originally wanted to go to russia i went to germany partly because my girlfriend was going there lana shebinger and i was quick with the language and uh my old landlady was born in 1900 and i was renting a room a tiny room in in berlin and she told me she had been a nurse in world war one and told me how sad it was that all the mentally ill uh had died in in that war and that how the same thing happened in world war ii and she told me about how sad it was that she'd never gotten married because there were no german men around after world war one but i also started taking classes uh in in germany and at that time there were still a few old nazi professors just about to retire you know very very old and i remember there was one guy who would talk about the impact on ovaries of women exposed to stress and how this would damage their ovaries and that this was like people who'd uh you know been told they were about to be executed and they would do a before and after on these ovaries one of these horrific experiments this was a physician in in berlin and so i got involved in it with a group of people and really as a kind of intellectual garlic for living in uh berlin and this is in in 1980 81 i started reading medical journals from the nazi period and even the librarians didn't like that i remember the process of stats bibliotheque in downtown berlin they're like why do you want to you know you're not supposed to be reading these old nazi journals these are just medical journals hundreds and hundreds of journals and i just read them and read them and read them and read them and looking for details i'd find like a veterinary medicine journal that would have a joking section where they'd say oh we found a cow with a swastika on his forehead a natural black swastika isn't that funny you know or i'd find stories about tobacco i find stories about abortion i'd find stories about excluding jewish medicine or jews from medicine or who's been promoted who's been demoted who's been nazified i discovered there was an entire nazi physicians league that was just the top nazi the most nazi of the physicians i discovered that physicians joined the nazi party in a higher proportion than any other profession that they joined the ss in a higher proportion than any other profession why is that do you think you do have a sense because the nazi regime is a kind of sanitary utopia right it was to create this purified world of that would control the mind and the and fertility so gynecologists physici and psychiatrists were the top they were the most notified of the various medical professions control the body through sterilization abortion control the mind through psychiatry they killed a lot of the mentally ill and you can read their professional journals and i'm not sure these had ever been read since i also went to east germany because remember this is way before the wall fell and they had a very special collection of taboo literature it's kind of your point about should mein kampf be read well of course in east germany nowhere close right and so but not only that time magazine couldn't be read and newsweek couldn't be read and this file this this like chamber that the foreign scholars were allowed to look through had all of the old nazi literature and nazi scientific literature and time magazine and newsweek and a whole pornography section as well so all of the taboo topics so here i'm researching in the west i'm researching these topics the librarians didn't even want me to look at in the east i was sort of going over there you know i would hitchhike over there and overstay my welcome and things like that but in any event um i i noticed that there was this kind of taboo of talking about the big eugenics i'd already been as a kind of a radical graduate student at harvard working with all the the marxist biologists there we'd already had a critique of eugenics and women being excluded from science and south african apartheid was a big deal and uh arthur jensen's you know blacks have lower iqs and so there's a whole nest of controversial hot topics you know around sociobiology around race and iq around women and scholarship and so forth but we weren't looking at nazi medicine so i thought i'll look at the big eugenics not just this smaller stuff only 50 000 people are sterilized in in in california but there were you know huge numbers sterilized in in nazi germany so the more i i looked into that i realized there was a book there but i had also started noticing this other weird stuff why were they anti-tobacco why did they recognize uh why were the nazis the first to recognize asbestos as as causing mesothelioma why did they try to ban food dyes why did they why are they the first culture in the world to encourage women to do breast self-exams i told my mom this and she she told me that in the 50s women weren't even supposed to touch their breasts in texas and here in nazi germany you've got these mandatory breast self-exams way before this was done in the united states you had the first laws banning the x-raying of pregnant women already in the early 1930s it was standard medical practice they recognized that this could harm the fetus harmed the race way before radiation was recognized as a hazard in england or or america i started noticing these things and i have an eye for uh oddities i like the weird the contradictory that which doesn't fit and i remember finding a german magazine a newspaper actually from 1919 that talked about a holocaust of six million jews using that language how could this be you know i researched it was i thought it wasn't even real and so i went and actually got the original newspaper and there it was it's just one of those oddities of life that just happens just weird stuff happens right that's the source of conspiracy theories right exactly uh so weird stuff happens but you know there's a inkling you know that that couldn't have been written in another time in history it was much less likely that little coincidence to have happened in another so it has uh some kind of resonance with something yeah that captures something deep to the culture yeah that's why i'm interested in probing i mean history is about seeing the universal through the particular in a way and so you look for the weird particular and then pull at that string to see if there's something there is it that weird you know i i did a project i never published on it's what i call pseudo swastikas which is a lot of companies in nazi germany made logos that look pretty much like a swastika you start looking at them they're you know they're disturbingly like a swastika and i call those pseudo swastikas it's one of the many things i filed a way to be a great project just to write how did this kind of visual iconography you know you weren't supposed to do that you weren't supposed to sell your you know bathroom cream with a swastika on it yeah you know so they would do these little things that looked pretty much like a swastika or i looked at i would look at humor what are they laughing at what are they smiling at i i didn't even know germans had humor yeah that's a good discovery oddly enough even hitler had a sense of humor there's one speech he gives which is actually pretty funny where he's ridiculing all the 29 tiny tiny political parties oh there's this party you know that party it's actually kind of funny so we do have this again this scarecrow image even of of hitler and his personality and this and that but i started noticing that there was this stuff that looks like kind of modern hitler being a vegetarian and uh trying to limit alcohol and this and that and and then i got a call but i'd sort of filed it away and then i got a call from the holocaust museum would i like to be the first senior scholar in residence at the holocaust museum i said well i wasn't really working on nazi stuff that much anymore but i did have this idea maybe looking at how it could be that the nazis had the world's most aggressive anti-cancer campaign which is kind of like an amazing fact and i said it's not exactly about the holocaust in a way it's about the opposite it's about what was nazism that it was so seductive that it could become so powerful that something like the holocaust could be could be possible and they said no that sounds great do whatever you want you know and so i went down to washington dc and they were you know helped them build a little bit some of the racial hygiene exhibits some of the push and to show the sort of the medical aspect of the holocaust and so i ended up writing this this book on uh the nazi war on cancer which talks about how right before hitler is about to invade poland he's talking late into the night about uh how to cure cancer so for nazis racial hygiene encompasses like way more than we might think so it's like purifying it always and one terrifying and it's also much more normal and more familiar it's like regular in regular discussion it's like the famous line that if nazism ever comes to britain it'll be wearing a bowler hat and you know we we create an image of nazism which is this fantasy image yeah and you know they're human beings making these decisions and when it's tied to things like removing cancer so you're saying they kind of the the effort of purification walks alongside with this effort of fighting cancer and then the final the difficult truth here is that there's a lot of innovation you know leading scientific innovation on fighting cancer it's not a bunch of blind robots following orders it's a period of massive innovation i mean they declared this soybeans to be the official bean of the third reich because they realized how you know how useful soy could be in in protein for for the people they built a whole car out of soybeans they pushed for a whole grain bread calling white bread a french revolutionary capitalist product and and they're they're right about whole grain bread it's better than you know so allegedly so far so far that's what we think we'll discover eventually that bread is the thing that's killing us uh well by the way i'm eating mostly uh meat so mostly carnivore and that's been a discovery for me i don't care what like i'm not making a general statement about the population but me personally how i feel i i like i've discovered fasting so i often like on days like this when it's pretty stressful um i'll eat once a day and only meat or mostly meat and that's that's amazing to me from a scientific discovery perspective that that makes me feel way better you know there's not scientific support why might make you feel but i don't care the point is i've done the experiments on the end of one and it just makes me feel better well i think fasting is way undervalued i mean where do we get the idea you need three meals a day i have a friend at harvard and he he'll go seven or eight days periodically without food he drinks water but he considers it a kind of purification and you know we're in a world where it's too easy to get food yeah we're in a world i mean most animals are living in a sense at the on the brink of starvation but we have technologies and social conditions that allow it it's way too easy to to find a piece of cake or a donut and that's not something we evolved with we've been talking about purification in that negative context but you know there's appealing ways of uh of minimalism of removing things from your life of of seeking especially for me being like ocd and and a scientist i i do like this simplification of things of the this taxonomy things i just recently um storage got uh hacked by ransomware uh for you see storage devices called qnap nas and you know 50 terabytes of data locked up and you i can't so it's lost but you know it was at first it was a gut punch and it really hurts and a bunch of stuff is gone um but it's also uh freeing yeah well there's a uh my favorite new yorker cartoon is where the guy's about to die as i say he's 90 years old he's got tubes in his nose very last words are i wish i'd bought more crap uh yep and that's now in this amazing world applies to digital world too like you don't need to store everything you just live in the moment and live for the people well that's one of my fears of bitcoin is losing your password i know a friend his son you know mined i don't know how many dozens of bitcoins and and lost his password you know and so what can he do and there's a whole i think silicon valley episode about something like that where the three three comma club you know asshole billionaire is trying to find his old uh laptop with the password on it yeah that's the kind of dread people feel in the modern age losing your bitcoin password or for me it'd be like last pass password it's hilarious we're funny funny creatures what um what else can we say outside of cancer about medicine about engineering lessons about medicine lessons about engineering and lessons about sort of applied science and nazi germany so before we leave the subject is there some truths that resonate with you still that's applicable for today well you know historians celebrate contingency or at least recognize contingency and we always say things didn't have to turn out the way they did they were you can't always you know foresee what's going to happen um and there were definitely missteps and uh the potency of that ideology was such that it it it trapped a lot of people and i guess by the time it becomes essentially a wartime operation that becomes very very dangerous when it's bl whatever the ideology is once it's blended with uh warfare that's that's catastrophic one of the things that's ignored i'm very interested in things that are ignored and one of the things that we ignore now on on something even like the climate catastrophe is the role of the military i mean there's a huge amount of carbon emissions from military operations again just part of the loop we're not we're not closing well military is really interesting because you know i'm a ai person robots and most of my work when i was a pg student was darpa and dod funded and i think that's probably true for a lot of science that's funded especially engineering is funded by the military and you know again i don't i really want to be careful drawing parallels between nazi germany and any anything else but you know there there is a sense in which i remember when i was a it hit me when one one of the people close to me when i was a phd one of the faculty um she refused to take funding from from dod from darpa that was interesting to me i thought but what's the i mean it's not like you're not you're not taking a stand against the war you just don't want to take money from tangentially associated military kind of efforts and that little stand i mean that had an impact on me you know that the last at least it woke me up to to like this is something we should be very very careful with for me artificial intelligence is uh you know much of the darpa research on autonomous vehicles and all kinds of robotics drones i mean that's pure research some of the biggest discoveries like i didn't think of it as military i thought of it as engineering and science but then when the drums of war start beating like say in some future time all of that machine is already there to turn it into into now lex is walking around and working on autonomous drones they're going to um you know swarm china or swarms whoever some terrorist um part of the world and then all of a sudden all my widgets are being used for that that's why i've been waking up more and more to uh there's been something released called like the ai reports eric schmidt was one of the co-authors of it which is essentially saying that because china is developing autonomous weapons systems us should not ban autonomous weapons systems and should also be doing it so basically put ai into our weapons of war and that that escalation that race is terrifying uh just like all the things you mentioned but that particular one for me is close because now too closely are the ideas of ai and war are being linked very much yeah i mean one of the things i think that is rarely taught in universities is what would you not do for money right i mean in a basic class on machine learning or even statistics or history what would you not do for money what should you not do for money i have a lot of my own colleagues who work for big tobacco you know carrying water for them in court a huge essentially a mercenary army of historians a vast undiagnosed you know essentially a hidden invisible army they don't put it on their cvs and it's going on the same thing with a lot of the technical fields what wouldn't you do for for money at stanford there used to be secret phds secret research projects that was that was kicked off campus in 1971 with the whole 60s radicalism but nonetheless uh individual professors still work for all kinds of military operations we're setting up a new school of sustainability at stanford and it's going to be pretty much in bed with big oil as well big oil is going to be funding a lot of that you know what kind of influence if they have a seat at the table if they're giving money if they're gifts if their names are on certain projects what influence is that going to have this is what really bothered me people don't often have they don't have integrity uh in the way that i hope they would this is one of the things i learned in academia i think a lot of people from money you know if i give you a million dollars to murder somebody i think most people would not right uh a billion dollars that number starts uh decreasing but it's still pretty like it i think we'll be happy with direct murder not being done for money but like subtle stuff just pressures and it could be with like let me buy you a drink and just you know laugh about stuff become friends that's a subtle pressure i'm very upset with how many people would just unknowingly like tell themselves the story ah what's the harm and i see that with uh for example me personally at mit a lot of people i admire a lot of people i still admire friends of mine i mean for example in doing autonomous vehicle research there's car companies that fund that research and the car companies say no of course we're not going to influence anything no that's like you do it's wide open do whatever you want but the fact is you know they give millions of dollars and i'm disappointed that actually a lot of scientists in that context are still afraid even though legally it says they cannot the car company cannot at all influence the research they still start leaning slowly towards the ideas that that company espouses and that's a harmless perhaps topic versus big tobacco but i would argue it has harm on innovation yeah well it skews innovation the yeah what happened at stanford was philip morris and the other big tobacco companies they had a massive denial campaign to deny that exposure to someone else's smoke could kill you when in fact it can it kills tens of thousands of americans every year still they set up an entire conspiracy body called the center for indoor air research and funded hundreds of scientists to basically say you know it's all genetic if you get cancer well you had it coming right because of your genes your ancestor your hormones whatever well that was just that that was broken apart through what was called the master settlement agreement but it it was rejuvenated and reinvigorated by something called the philip morris external research program which continued with the same facts lines and executives funding universities like stanford millions and millions of dollars and when i came to stanford there were millions and millions of dollars being given to medical professors by philip morris as part of the philip morris external research program well what were they researching they're researching genetics they're researching diet anything but cigarettes causing cancer and giving the non-giving the friendly research as as philip morris often called a bigger voice they got money they got jaw you know it amplified that as a research tradition remember there's nothing natural in a university about how many professors there are of human origins versus a.i this is all a political decision in a very non-democratic institution universities are less democratic than the vatican you know the at least the pope is elected who elects uh you know a president of a university or a dean for that matter and so what happened was uh i helped launch a campaign to get philip morris off campus and people started coming out of the woodwork like well does this mean i shouldn't be working for the cia does this mean i shouldn't be working for big oil does it's like what you work for big oil and our faculty voted against pushing philip morris off campus but philip morris got bad press from it and so they voluntarily withdrew the entire program so we started it was kind of a a lesson in that you can lose a battle but win a war if you're doing the right thing and so by standing up even though our own faculty wouldn't you know back us in kicking philip morris out of the medical school philip morris did a cost benefit analysis found well probably really not worth the kudos we get for you know embracing stanford so it can have an influence and in this case the influence was simply by rewarding giving voice to the people who were blaming cholesterol rather than cigarettes and of course we know that historically the tobacco industry created a lot of these theories these alternative theories of what causes heart disease that stress causes heart disease that salt or that anything but cigarettes they funded that that research to to skew the whole research in their direction you are edited a book titled agnetology this is an interesting term so you mentioned it earlier the making and unmaking of ignorance where you explore the topic of ignorance or the authors explore the topic of ignorance in different applications in different contexts oh let me ask the ridiculous big philosophical question what is the nature of human ignorance well the first thing to say is that it's infinite einstein quote or stupidity or something i forget what it is yeah well attributed the point is that you know there's there's probably trillions of planets in the universe and we know one you know a tiny piece of one but not only that who are the we i mean we're all born as you know we started as single-celled organisms right some sperm and some egg get together that's certainly ignorant and then we're ignorant and we're each one of us there's an ontogeny of of knowledge you say but an ontogeny of ignorance is well we grow up we have to learn but almost everything that has been known has been forgotten if you think about the names of ordinary people and names of the neanderthal did they even have names most of the history of the world has been forgotten the we have a few shreds a few traces that we try history is a kind of resurrection projects a kind of archaeological project and a genealogical project where we look back and and we find traces and and it's very biased uh i'm interested in in empires that we don't even know anything about you know and there are whole empires that have that are gone if things don't leave a written trace you know we know something about mayan cosmology because we've got some of their stele and a few of their codices four codices but we know that dozens that were burned by diego delanda the you know inquisitorial spanish friar who thought these were just heresies and so burned so that knowledge is all lost you think there's a lot of like deep wisdom about reality that is lost forever of course of course that's so sad well it is sad but the human condition is sad i mean but but then if we can study ignorance that's also a positive thing agnetology the study of ignorance the study of the cultural production of ignorance is cultural production sites interrupt cultural production of ignorance yes yes you can so the ignorance is not just a manifestation of what it means to be human it's also forced back onto you through the culture that's the missing piece that people don't pay enough attention to it's not a natural vacuum we explore like some empty cave it's it's there are factories of ignorance the tobacco industry when they built their propaganda engines to deny that cigarettes caused cancer they measured exactly how much ignorance could be created by watching one of their videos they would show that uh watching one of their propaganda videos in the 1970s produced a 17 increase in the people not willing to say that cigarettes cause cancer so this is this is i call it agnometrics they actually measured the success of their propaganda and i'm sure this has been done in in in marketing and in other fields as well but the that framing of it somehow is um [Music] terrifying because it seems like a very effective way to be scientific about how to sort of um create doubt in the mind exactly it's diabolical and luckily we have some of the tobacco industries own internal documents the one that is ones that were not destroyed and we actually know we have some traces as to which ones were destroyed we know that the most sensitive were destroyed and we know that some of the ones that were sequestered by whistleblowers or by you know disgruntled spouses or whatever that those contain the real gems and the truth and one of the ones that was leaked already in 1981 was the doubt is our product memo that we don't just make cigarettes we make two products we make doubt and we make cigarettes we make cigarettes but we can only keep selling cigarettes so long as we can keep selling ignorance and that then becomes a template of sorts for climate denial and for all kinds of other denial engines that are produced by the 1500 trade associations in in washington dc so this this is something new in the research enterprise of the world after world war ii you have this enormous trust in science trust and research so what could be more effective than big tobacco saying look we're supporting research we want to get at the truth we're funding hundreds of millions of dollars of research which is what exactly what they did what they didn't say was it was all an effort to distract from the truth that cigarettes caused cancer and a million other diseases too blindness amputation all kinds of other diseases all of that was hidden covered up through a distraction process richard nixon declares war on cancer in 1971 it's called the war on cancer cigarettes were excluded even though cigarettes caused a third of all cancers all cancer deaths cigarettes were excluded because the tobacco industry successfully argued that cigarettes cause cancer is not a scientific fact but a political opinion much like the argument that guns don't cause death you know pulling the trigger causes death or shooters or whatever in other words it's all about breaking down the chain of causation into pieces that serve your interests so it's not that cigarettes cause cancer it's this maybe the smoky them at most the way they're even denying that it's the fact you have lungs that cause cancer it's it's blaming the victim and they had a thousand ways to blame the victim i mean there's some legitimacy to this line of our argument which is why it sticks which is figuring out what is the causation of things is hard to figure out a lot of the politics of science have to do with which parts of the causal chain do you view as real or not real when we say that carbon causes climate change well what causes carbon if it's exxon causing carbon is it the person driving the car causing it or is it the republican party causing that or is it the tea party causing that or is it big tobacco and big oil controlling the republican party or is it what is it the jews controlling the weather which is where the conspiracy theories come in or the lizards so and and whatever sticks you try it out and if you're a tobacco company you're going to actually literally be scientific about it and try different options the genius of the tobacco conspiracy the tobacco denial campaign which is born on december 14 1953 we know on an hour-by-hour basis how it worked is to create an alliance between solid research or as they called it impassionate dispassionate research and to tar all of their opponents as fanatical emotional hysterical political you mentioned uh marxism and at harvard a couple decades ago or something like that so 30 years ago you wrote the value free science book purity and power and modern knowledge which is interesting that you kind of what you were describing then seems to be a concern for people now still so you're i think referencing more nazi germany and how social scientists would attack or defend marxism feminism and other social movements using science there's a you know depending on who you talk to i just spent a day with jordan peterson you know there's some arguments that science is not being leveraged in some part of the university which bothers me because most of the university at least like mit is doing engineering and not ideology doesn't seep in yet but the concern they have is ideology seeps in eventually if you let it in at all anyway i ask all that do you do you have some modern concerns about the seeping in of ideology into academic research in these social movements for or against marxism for or against you know uh well nobody's for racism but you know on the topic like anti-racism all those kinds of uh critical race theory things and then also on the feminism and gender studies and all those kinds of things yeah i mean these have always been in the university when people have been most adamant in saying that science is a neutral value free enterprise it's times like the 1950s when there weren't blacks and there weren't even women in universities so what i discovered was that value neutrality or this ideology of that we are value-free it really arose as a defensive shield to prevent greater inclusion to prevent you know questioning of the priorities of science the practice of science the nature of science now we're in a period now i think of a kind of inclusive revolution where people are realizing well we can't have you know universities that look too much a certain way there's probably going to be in that omelette making you know there's going to be a few uh eggs that get broken and uh i think people may exaggerate the extent to which that's going in is it's definitely real like cancer culture all those kinds of things i mean it's definitely real but it's also they're in a way it's also a distraction from looking at big power in a university if big oil is going to control or at least influence the direction of the sustainability school at stanford isn't that a bigger issue than than whether we have we can't say certain words on campus in other words there's there's some very interesting and complex complex aspects to this and the idea that certain words should not be said or that certain people should not be invited an invitation to a university is always political i mean who do you invite who do you not invite much as an admissions process is if a student is admitted to stanford what that really means is 96 of the applicants did not get in they were rejected they were cancelled from a stanford move four percent are admitted they call it an admissions committee they should should call it a rejection committee yes when we hire someone in in my department at stanford we get 300 applications and maybe we accept one it's not a hiring committee it's a non-hiring committee that sounds like toxic cancer culture all these rejections everybody should be accepted in that sense it's the essence of meritocracy is that selection is involved in any hiring decision in any because in a way when you were hired into a university you were hired to control the means of production at least part of it and this part of the politics of it is invisible to the undergraduates because they are consumers and you're free as a consumer to eat whatever you want but you're not free to own the means of production to say what's on the menu and that's that's where the power is you have to ask the question where is the power in the university i think that uh like at mit the entire administration should get fired regularly and and more power put in the hands of faculty and students there is an overgrowth that happens that it feels like administrators are more easily influenced by big tobacco than faculty and maybe it's me being sort of romantic about the idea of faculty but if you're in the battle doing the research i feel like well i don't know i don't know i don't know but it feels like at the the administration helps you delude yourself longer so it prevents you from waking up it's like no it's okay to take this fine oh jeffy epstein that's okay and oh okay so he got he went to prison let's just keep it a little bit secret it's fine just keep taking the money and i feel like that comes from the administration more than the faculty well there's certainly a cult of celebrity a cult of money donors have the remember in the whole scandal about the side door entrance uh in in universities there's always been the you know the front door and the back door where the the back door is the the rich donors the kids of the rich donors the legacy kids that you still get so there are a lot of ways universities get corrupted they get corrupted through money they get corrupted through influence and that should be recognized we're jumping around a little bit but you i read you also do work on human origins so we we we mentioned this earlier let me ask another big philosophical question um what what's human what makes us human what is human and uh where did that humanness come from that's exactly the question we need to problematize because it's what i call the gandhi question it's like uh you know gandhi's ask what do you think of western civilization and he says it would be a good idea you know and so when did humans evolve you know well not yet so we don't talk about you know when did you know we talk about the rise of modern humanity and what's happened in the last 50 or 60 years or so which i think is a good thing intellectually is that we've smeared out humanness to mean many different things it's not just tool use it's not just upright posture upright posture goes back at least five million years tool use goes back at least two and a half million years stone two years but since wasps and chimpanzees use tools then it's got to be even older so that that's actually one of the things i'm interested is how have different notions of what is human influence our theories of human origins and in particular there's sort of the problem with of what i call like sodomy in the uncanny valley which is how long ago would you be willing to date someone say someone that existed say 5 million years ago 10 million years ago 3 million years ago in other words when is it a date or one night stand i mean that's strong okay either one all right let's say be the the mother of your children um that's a lot of commitment but yeah but it's an interesting question because after world war ii as a result of nazism no one wanted to be the one to say that this particular fossil we've just found was anything less than fully human so there's a projection of humanness arbitrarily back into the past so that even these little monkey-like creatures ramapithe scenes rhombopithicus were being declared to have folkways and mores and language which is ridiculous no one want to be one to say that neanderthals were anything less than fully human so it's a very interesting question at what point are they us i mean human origins is very much an identity quest it's when did we become us which sort of begs the question what are we who are we um and how much is that is the hardware evolution question and versus the software like what the actual development of society like can't you argue that we became human with uh with agriculture i mean can't you argue that we became human with the industrial revolution well certainly by then they are us but agriculture is only 12 000 years ago that's a blink in the eye right that's that's yesterday it's interesting prior to the 19th century most scholars thought that the pyramids were at the beginning of time essentially they were closer to the beginning of time than they are to us now it's a blink in the eye you know we use the metaphor of a meter you know the earth is 5 billion so that's a meter the natural history of upright humans is 5 million so that's that would be like one millimeter this would be the thickness of the white of your fingernail and then the pyramids are five thousand so that's a thousandth of a millimeter a micron which is the amount taken off when you brush your fingers on your your jacket so the there's a natural history of humanity and then there's the history of our constituents we're all stardust because all of our complex atoms began in supernovas many billions of years ago but upright posture 5 million agriculture only a few thousand years ago we cultivate dogs a couple hundred thousand years ago so those are paleolithic instruments cats are neolithic instruments because they're used to kill vermin dogs are used to to hunt with us but there is what you say this co-evolution our social aspect yeah and our physical aspect even the fact that we have whites of the eyes we're the only animal with whites of the eyes and the whites of the eyes tell intent they tell direction they tell interest they know if you look at something i can tell what you're looking at because there's a lateral resolution i can tell what you're looking at that's recent and the people who do reconstruction for museums they want to create what i call an ethnographic identity with the viewer and so they fantasize about all these other early hominids non-human pre-human hominids if that's a word as having eyes like us but they probably didn't and they were probably not self-aware at least the early ones i can't have been self-aware the way we are insofar as we are they may not have spoke so i'm interested in basically when did we become what we think is human it's clear that when we start burying the dead and making jewel making jewelry and and when we in a sense invent fantasy when we invent deception that's human that's full of human we become human by thinking there's a world that really is not i mean that's that feels like we're starting to operate in the space of ideas more and more so to have deception to have imagination you start to be able to have ideas and share them and it feels like the sharing is the thing that really develops the idea so it's not you come up with ideas and you we become able to sort of understand what each other is thinking some animals can do this to a certain extent dogs have a certain empathy but it's it's limited it's highly limited but you could probably argue that the dogs got that from the humans yeah i mean humans and dogs have co-evolved have definitely co-evolved because it's over a hundred thousand years we've been working together there but but all our hands have evolved with tools and so i'm trying to figure out now the original purpose is the purpose of a julian hand axis the old the first beautiful tool made by humans which were made unchanged what kind of axe is this they're called the shulian hand axes they're the these beautiful teardrop shaped objects that go back 1.5 million years and what's your thought about his possible purposes well the most important thing to murder is that a jealous jealous husband comes home what's astonishing is that no one knows what they were used for so they may have been maps they may have been weapons they may have been chopping devices they may have been sexual displays oh like ornaments to display something versus actual products like the peacock's tail right something to attract a mate uh no one really knows but what's interesting is how in becoming ignorant of those that's a form of knowledge in other words a lot of this is one reason i'm interested in ignorance is that really to understand something and especially to to teach something you have to know what people don't know and that's that's hard often it's very hard to remember what it's like to not know something once you know it very hard very hard to do but you sort of have to do that to recreate that moment you can you can teach well one nice thing i like about the internet is you can look at old tweets of yours and to be like okay it for some reason it brings to mind like okay that's where my mind was another interesting exercise is like google search history so i i think for everybody it keeps you can look up your own history of what you search for it's so cool to go back to like 2008 or something like that like okay i remember where your mind was and immediately actually it's a nice way to restore at least an inkling of the ignorance you had like have a peek into the ignorance you had about the world and also to discover the things you've forgotten the new ignorance you have now he's like oh right right i was really concerned about you know this and that and it it's i i do think that as you're saying it's um it's both sad and illuminating to think about that most of what we've known even like the deep wisdom is forgotten as a human civilization but you know we we create it new all the time as well so right hopefully forgetting is a feature and not just a bug it's like those mice that can't forget they go insane right if you imagine all of your memories as present yeah that's that's a recipe for insanity you have to to forget to learn right learning is unlearning and [Music] which is uh why i drink no uh and uh then write some blues songs um about forgetting a broken heart okay you mentioned uh amber and stone collection i just have to ask does that connect to human origins or just a personal love what is it about stone collecting that attracts you well scholars tend to be text oriented i tend to think books are overrated uh we uh we evolved without books uh you know i walk for a couple of hours in the forest every day i gather mushrooms and all kinds of things just located pieces of the 1953 resolution airplane crash uh outside of um half moon bay just a couple days ago i like finding things have you ever found uh pieces of a crash ufo no not yet okay all right let me know please if you do but of course we have extraterrestrial other stuff i mean we have i have i'm like meteorites so i'm i'm into that uh and so i i'm interested in stone stone quality i grew up in southern texas and grew up surrounding surrounded by people who who would hunt for stone and gather stone and cut stone i cut stone as well i'm a lapidary and so i have this interest in the physical qualities of objects sometimes it's called material culture but it's just stuff and i'm interested to know how different cultures have manipulated stuff worked stuff stone wood things like that and also the fantasies people project into it so i'm doing a book on all the different ways different cultures have found different images in stone like rorschach tests and so in in india they love agates with hindu temples in them and and altars and uh in america they like you know three crosses on the mount and uh if you can find a stone with the word allah in it that's beloved in yemen or saudi arabia so there's a long history of people projecting fantasy into stone and i'm using that as a kind of a a metaphor they also i'm also looking at the rise of hobbies and and amateur stonework and how a lot of our gem gemologic techniques were actually invented by amateurs which means just lovers as opposed to professionals the amateur is the lover and hobbies i don't know if you know but the word hobby comes from a hobbled horse and so you would hobble a horse me to keep it from running that's hobbling it with a with a stick or a string and then kids would ride a hobbled horse for play a horse on a stick and riding a hobbled horse becomes riding a hobby horse and then that becomes a hobby and so hobbies become this so-called job you can't lose in the great depression in the 1930s and then they explode um and so when i was a kid people would collect coins or stamps or fossils or this or that so i'm interested in that collecting passion so it's interesting um the development of hobbies because it feels like the future of human civilization would be very hobby driven like um some of the like i i often now because of this particular little thing i'll do with the podcast i get to interact with photographers and videographers and i'm disappointed to find how many professionals are not very good and how many hobbyists are very good yeah it's so it's well if they're amateurs they're the lovers i mean they're loving it that's what that means from a moor you're an amateur if you're a lover of the thing and it you're not in for the money yeah you know because you're obsessed but the sort of as the gdp as the as our freedom grows to sort of financially to be able to have a hobby it feels like there'll be more lovers more amateurs in the world and not just for the artistic pursuits but like science uh technology development building you know uh building all kinds of technologies almost like as a hobby yeah you have much more freedom to figure out what is the thing you love doing and actually over time that just you won't even notice but i'll start making money and yeah that's really fascinating and yeah it does kind of uh i mean when did that originate just the collection the white it goes through different stages people have always gathered the odd thing to make something else but you also get this tradition of what's called curiosity cabinets especially in the renaissance which replaced the kind of treasure chambers of the ancient sultans or kings or whatever and you get these curiosity cabinets they were often linked with magical practices alchemical practices people would gather besoirs or they would gather they would have an alligator hanging from the ceiling or they would have a rare you know shrunken head or whatever and that's part of the rise of natural history the idea you taxonomize the world you classify the world you look for the rare object the rarity and rarity still is a kind of virtue like the recent news about trying to figure out ball lightning when i was growing up ball lightning was the big question does it exist does it not exist and now there's new evidence of how it actually might wait what really there's new evidence yes yeah there's i grew up with that my dad when i was young told me i asked him like how do i win a nobel prize he said uh invent a time machine or figure out how ball lightning works and so i got really excited i was like damn it i'm gonna figure out how this ball lightning works it's very interesting from a history of science point of view because it's so rare that in a way it doesn't exist it you can't replicate it you can't make it does it really exist it's a little bit like libyan glass another thing i collect is libyan glass which is a tectite which falls as a result of a meteorite a meteorite hits the earth blasts earth up into space it falls back down as a glass that's called a tectite and there's a rare form of it called libyan glass which fell probably around 20 million years ago and now works out of the sahara every now and then it was the most valuable stone of antiquity the centerpiece of tuttan kamon's breastplate is made of this beautiful yellow gemstone libyan glass so rarity is something that the hobbyists have always liked to cherish the rarity the odds and science has a kind of often aversion as a kind of a love-hate relationship with rarity and novelty science is often trying to pursue novelty to make discoveries but if you can't replicate it it's kind of like well does it really exist yeah which is why i mean ufos and aliens and all those kinds there's a general aversion to that because it's like it's a one-time event uh right it's it's sad because there's uh just like you said singular events or rare events are somehow really inspiring to us and so you kind of have to balance that yeah there's a scientific process but you also have to like oh the it's the thing you you find with the weird the the peculiar it's like huh yeah what is it even the universe itself it could be that the universe begins and then we'll end say in a cold death and that's it i mean it could be a one-off thing or it could be one of an infinite many cycles oh and maybe all of the laws of nature are recreated anew with each cycle yeah or maybe what we're assuming about the big bang there's some element of falsity maybe the speed of light is not constant but changes over time that would throw into question all kinds of theories about dark matter and dark energy yeah and even the age of the universe and i to me there's very likely trillions of uh conversations going on like this on other planets yeah in different yeah no doubt that's exactly there were different kinds of drugs different communication styles different time scales at which life form is or what life looks like or how life behaves or what life is and all those things it kind of yeah every time you think about this it's more and more humbling just this whole fog of ignorance yeah i mean i mean what drives me crazy is wondering about the beautiful gemstones on other planets i call them exo agates you know they must be unbelievable features and forms which are unimaginable to us because one thing we do know is that nature is very creative i mean we are the product of nature and we seem to be fairly creative and so imagine what else uh nature's created but even that's unknown it you know is how common is life in the universe is it is it common or is it rare we only have a sample size of one you know it could be quite common or it could be even unique yeah i i tend to believe it's everywhere except for the fact that we don't even know how to define what life is like what is everywhere exactly we're talking about it's it's very possible that there's not anywhere in the universe an organism with two legs and two arms with two eyes and mostly hairless walking around at this time scale but like well there could be very different kind of other things um it was interesting that some people this is not a common belief but a friend now named lee cronin he's a chemist and uh biologist and he believes that if we ran evolution over and over and over and over on earth you get very different not just you wouldn't just get different organisms you get very different biology yeah that's quite impossible yeah and that's a weird thing to i mean most people kind of assume well it kind of you know it fits to the environment and you're going to get similar things maybe not humans and so on but to get very different biology like starting from the bacteria to the you know just how well the idea that it would be dna based dna on some other planet that seems to me like saying they're speaking swahili on some other planet i mean the odds of that particular architecture i think are infinitesimally small what's the coolest stone you've ever seen oh my god there's so many and what what what defines is it rarity is it just raw beauty what what captivates your i like excitement a storied stone i have a very beautiful fair burn agate which is multiple layers and there's something i call agate paralysis because to polish it you have to go through the layers which means you're destroying the layers and maybe what should be done is it should be like a movie where you you film the entire process of cutting and polishing so that it's not dead in other words what was the diamond when it started rough the the rough diamond is gone but if you could sort of do a filmic version yeah of a cutting process so that the the stone would exist in a from a pre-polished to a polished state all as a kind of nft or something another that should be nfc that's right so the other thing i fantasize about is how pattern recognition technology will probably in the future allow us to discover all kinds of amazing stones including for example fossil skulls fossil skulls of humans now it's kind of a chance process that you discover a skull in east africa but why not have a drone moving constantly scanning for pattern recognition of human skull human teeth very slowly and then on the surface you mean just above the surface just 10 feet above the surface 20 feet above the surface no sorry you think you'll be able to find skulls on the surface yes yes in the middle of a place that no one has looked which these areas are vast right so it could be found on the surface then move to the next layer then then find it under the surface as well there's lidar there's all kinds of ways we're finding jungles and jungle cities in in under the amazon that people didn't know about do you think there's something out there that would just blow your mind oh for sure for sure yeah no doubt oh man and uh how much of it is a little bit underground right or how much of it is in the ocean yeah i mean here right here we are in the bay area we know that much of the native american civilization here was under the bay because six thousand years ago the bay was dry it was a river not a bay and so all of those whatever material culture archaeological traces existed there are now at least preserved under the water so i think we're just beginning to to touch the it could be treasure too i mean like literally like you said we lose the wisdom or we'll lose the knowledge but i i mean um if there's the pyramids right it's the great wonders of the world there might be other wanderers that are completely lost yeah just i mean one of the stones you asked about stones i like i i like stones for example every now and then dinosaurs would eat rocks as gizzard stones and then you find them in their in their guts and their bones well every now and then they would eat a piece of petrified wood so the idea that something was a tree and then stone and then swallowed by a dinosaur and ground up in the gizzard and polished and then left in a you know yeah so i like things that have been through dramatic there's a story there there's this yeah i mean that that's okay the the really fascinating thing why seeing allah or crosses in the stone is it feels like the stone has wisdom because it's been there's a there's a it's been through so many generations of humans it's like bigger right it's seen it all also it's also the intellectual question of intelligent design in other words when people say intelligent design mostly it's bogus but there are several interesting examples of actual intelligent design meaning when is a stone the product of artifice and when is it a geofact produced by nature and that's that was an important discovery in the 19th century the the zone of percussion it's called the the percussion zone or how do you know that a signal from out of space is an intelligent signal and as opposed to hydrogen doing something or some natural thing that's the genuine problem of intelligent design how do you know if it's pi maybe if it's e if it's some you know pattern is how do you know that that's an intelligent signal how do you know that an artifact in the ground is you know we'll see in the clouds of a face it's called paradoia we have a kind of a built-in ability to see faces where they really aren't there right that's why kids like clowns you know we've evolved that so babies evolve it to recognize their parents and so forth but when is it a projection and when is it really in the in the in the stone and that was a big question with the rise of fossils you know if you find a a curly thing is that life or is it non-life is it you know people have made this mistake before you know they'll find a rock on on the moon or mars they say oh this is a face or whatever well you know no that's that's just projection that's paradoia i guess throughout science you have this problem of signal it just because something is beautiful doesn't mean it was i mean that's that's not a good signal to determine if it's intelligent design or natural evolution or natural design just because you're you see a stone that just yeah the pattern is is incredible how do you what do you know how do you know it's a fossil is one question namely the ex you know the remnants of an organism and how do you know if it was manipulated by a human you know this is a big problem in in trying to figure out the oldest art if you find scratchings on a bone is that a tally is it is it someone marking her her menstrual period is it phases of the moon or is it trampling by an antelope and that's that's called the science of taphonomy to discern when a marking on a bone or a stone is in a sense a an artifact or a geofactor an antelope effect and that's it's an intellectually challenging question and people want to fantasize they'll find a stone it looks like a carving is 300 000 years old generally i think those are just odd stones yeah you don't find the explosion of carved stone until around 60 000 years ago 50 60 000 years ago there seems to be something that paleontologists call the creative explosion or the big bang of the mind that produces a kind of ability to to see in the distance to identify a shape in an object to create a shape and an object that you don't get the neandertals don't seem to have ever done what we would call art that's a very interesting phenomenon you know but it requires that you have some understanding when is something art and when is it just oh that's a rock that looks like a face or some not necessarily understanding but a conception that's mutually agreed upon right that we're able to because maybe neanderthals maybe fish having a conception of art they just uh and this this also gets back to your question about professional bias and ideology because there's a huge reward for finding the oldest art yeah yeah if if everyone says it's 50 000 years ago and you find one that's 300 000 years ago that's a huge discovery so there's a there's a bias and this has been one of the things that's led to the probably the over-proliferation of different species of hominids because there's no academic reward for finding yet another example of someone else's species but there's a huge reward if you can find you know uh a lex friedmanite you know new you can name it after yourself or whatever yeah uh new fossil yeah that there's a huge professional reward to be the first at something and so those types of professional rewards also influence science and what kind of science gets done yeah so i'm always suspicious of uh and as we should all be when you can kind of intuit a financial and otherwise motivation i mean that's actually often in the modern age where i'm suspicious of conspiracy theories it's not that the logic doesn't make sense or something like that i personally actually just enjoy conspiracy theories i've been listening to um flat earth has discussed stuff recently it's kind of exciting for some reason it's like because i consider like what if it's true it's exciting to discover together like think through first principles like what does the world look like it's exciting i mean it's the childlike discovery of a new idea uh but the the reason i'm skeptical of a lot of conspiracy theories is when i see how popular you can get propagating those conspiracy theories how quickly it can form a large movement and it's like like such thin evidence it's like if loch ness exists there's just one i mean how does the reproduction work on that but now you talk about an animal that has only one in a population it just doesn't some of the things don't make sense no but see this is the logic side i don't even go that far i i the fact is if you say there's a loch ness monster i just see how quickly the idea spreads in popularity it's the people are hungry to discover something new just like you mentioned uh with the hominids and i'm very suspicious of where there's like a strange hunger for ideas because then they're they're less likely to be objective and rigorous in considering the validity of that idea i'm not going to the logic because actually flat earth is pretty logical yeah very logical if your logic is not the problem right so it's but this spreads really quickly and i and i once again with conspiracy theories i think it represents it's you have to think about the cause of causes or cause of cause of causes like you talked about which is like it represents some deeper uh fragmenting of the the common humanity we have the the the trust in the in the in the big community that is science and the big community that is government all that kind of stuff well that's why things like ball lightning are cool because it's like the scientists denied it but here it is exactly exactly and that's ultimately ends up everyone said i was insane but uh and but it's still exciting you said there's some breakthroughs i need to look it up yeah that's really cool it's pretty exciting yeah there's some new theories of how it actually might because i think i mean there's obviously several ways to prove that like one of them is to recreate in the lab which is standard that's probably very very difficult um just because we're on the topic of rocks i don't know if you've heard about this interstellar rock that flew through our uh called the muammar yes the cigar-shaped one the cigar was a fan of rocks what do you think about that one so well i think that generally i mean when the people were speculating it might be a spaceship i thought come on rocks do all kinds of crazy things they do a lot more than you realize they can do unbelievable unbelievably cool things they're parts of the desert they're in in utah where rocks move and create these long tracks and it's now we know it's from liquefaction and and and wind and various things but they're still unbelievably cool rocks can do almost anything and so just the fact that one comes from outside the solar system doesn't mean it has to be a spaceship so but nonetheless i thought it was awesome i thought it was really really cool and i i sort of wish it would happen more often i kind of hope it's trash from another alien civilization that'd be fantastic because if you're uh if if humans are all a lesson that we produce like more trash than we do intelligent signal and so the first thing to reach other civilizations i feel like would be our trash our pollution before the intelligence signal reaches them you mentioned this interesting term russianist uh the things we do for love for some reason you went to germany yes uh so you said you're pretty eloquent with german yeah like i learned german yeah did you ever learn russian a little bit i did learn russian yeah i studied actually russian as an undergraduate at indiana university for several years and then i wanted to do a rush i wanted to do russian and chinese as a graduate student because i thought this is kind of the future and harvard said nope has to be french and german and so i essentially gave up on my russian and chinese and the other part of that story is nonetheless i wanted to do something with russian i wanted to study how much the lamarcian ideology in biology in russia at the time that led to their distrust of genetics under stalin had to do with the fact that genetics was being pushed by the nazis and we tend to see those literatures in isolation the nazi nazis were racists the russians were you know environmentalists biased by lamarckian theories of heredity and rejected that part of darwin when they're right next to each other at the very same time there must be a connection and so i started reading into this and i was actually got a fulbright to go write a book on this and canceled all my classes i was teaching at the new school for social research at the time and uh i was i couldn't get a visa into the soviet union that was just barred admission for doing this project looking at how stalinist science had this anti-nazi aspect which we've overlooked which year was this this was the soviet union was still together yes it was in the uh late 1980s but before gorbachev was in power but it wasn't before 89. but still then there was a careful uh attention to well you never know how careful it was or through the cracks or you never know when something fails you don't always know why it failed but i was very disappointed and it sort of ended that the project i didn't have access to archives on it i could have obviously done it later but uh you know so like there was that curiosity initially but and then you focused on nazi and on the nazi side of yeah i mean the other thing was i was trying to figure out where to go for for a fulbright on a different year and i want to go to china and turns out you could only go to taiwan i didn't really want to go to taiwan and it was one in 50 odds of going to taiwan but it was one in three of going to germany and so i ended up going to germany i didn't have any particular interest in germany at that time but uh that's what i ended up doing is so i wrote you know so i wrote one book in german actually and i wrote two books on nazi germany and uh you know otherwise i might have been doing the same thing in russian or chinese yeah those are in other words history chooses us as much as we choose history right and those are really powerful cultures right um maybe can you comment on the german and the russian and the chinese how much language when you were reading those medical journals how how much are you able to understand how important is it to understand language deeply in order to understand the culture did you struggle and uh the opposite of that did you find the beauty of the moment like a richly understandable because you had a hold of the language well in the russian or chinese case no i never got that far with it i knew enough i could read some russian and i could tell there were anthropologists who were anti-nazi and therefore anti-genetics and they saw genetics as essentially nazi and that was enough for me i know there's something there but i didn't have enough time i wasn't allowed to go and actually research it in the german case you never fully know a language you know we don't fully know english um there's always more to learn i'm always learning new i i didn't know the word done last year d-u-n i mean some kind of brown color and i'm always finding new words you know which is kind of the words are near infinite as well right and new combinations i've coined several words too in in my life and um but it did help understanding the humor understanding the romance you know and mainly just plowing through all of these medical journals one after another after another there's a kind of a voyeuristic aspect to looking into this lost world you're reading texts by people who are who've died long ago and direct it's not like reading books by famous people it's like real people it's real people and they make mistakes and fascinating little stories i was looking at how the nazi tobacco industry had their own denial campaign which was pro-nazi but and pro-tobacco even though the nazi regime was anti-tobacco and they developed a lot of these rhetorical tricks that were later used by the americans like oh you can't trust that evidence it's merely statistical you can't trust the animal experiments because all it proves is that mice should not smoke but i notice just in passing these remarkable stories little hints there's a report from a japanese military man in one of these tobacco journals tobacco industry journals in the nazi period and they're talking about this brotherhood of all men through cigarettes and the tragedy that the chinese and the japanese who were fighting each other in a way that wanted nothing more than to smoke together and the chinese would sneak up to the japanese forts to try to find a japanese cigarette that had been thrown away and they'd be glowing and the japanese knew this and they would throw their cigarettes out the chinese would come and then the japanese would kill these chinese and then this guy is poetically lamenting the fact that even though all they want is a smoke yeah they nonetheless end up in the crosshairs and in death and so it's just weird i'm reading this translate from the japanese into german in a nazi tobacco industry newspaper i mean the layers of weirdness are really fascinating and touching but and those very kind of brotherhood stories actually resonated later because i mean that's how i feel about cigarettes some of my favorite moments in early life is about people connecting over a cigarette of course and that you know that works that that's those narratives yeah that's the movie that's right the movies it's called meat cute they the tobacco industry when they put cigarettes into a movie they put it in right at the moment where boy meets girl let me ask you just in all the research you've done with uh with nazi germany just from me from a conversational perspective i i was listening to a bunch of holocaust survivors uh recently just on youtube listening to interviews um also listening to nazi um ss soldier like they're still live or recently uh some of them especially the ones that deny many aspects of the holocaust it's so interesting to watch because they're still still it's so fascinating anyway i uh in your research are there interesting people to talk to they're still alive are they mostly that part of history is no longer living is in the books it is mostly no longer living that's one reason in the 1980s when i started working on nazi science i really did interview quite a few people elderly people people who had sort of slipped through the cracks you know maybe even should have been prosecuted so few people got prosecuted um but these were people who had racial theories who published yeah you know on these topics and they were guarded but these were the lives they lived and you know mainly they wanted people not to be talking too much about this so it gets sealed off and walled off and that's why the reading the medical literature itself was so much more valuable because there's no self-censorship it's just there i'm sure there's some censorship but it's what they said is what they said and it's it's immense it's immense and largely unread as i said there are hundreds and hundreds of nazi medical journals and people had not been reading those before i really started looking at them given that you studied these really difficult parts of human history and human nature with big tobacco and just these mechanisms of manipulation what gives you hope about the future oh all kinds of things give me hope the the forest gives me hope the wicked nature wikipedia gives me hope space exploration gives me hope all kinds of things give me hope the i had this insight the other day i walked through all of these giant redwoods which which were almost all cut they're not very far from here just you know half an hour straight west of where we are now even up in in redwood country and i had this idea that you know they're growing back now and every year they add how many you know cubic miles of wood if you count california as a whole but not only that the roots are all old growth if you think about it these are re-sprouting they're not from seeds these are re-sprouting so they have this tremendous resource underground that even the loggers couldn't kill right and so from these stumps you get what are called fairy rings which are you know like five trees coming in a ring around it each one competing to be the successor so they've seen this story before and they know to to re-sprout yeah and that i think is a very hopeful thing is that the roots are old growth and hopefully in 100 200 300 years it won't peak until around a thousand years from now you'll get these restoration of all of this magnificent uh old growth um but so many other things you know give me hope you know we have to have hope and i think that uh if the world is infinite there's infinitely many many ways for it to become fixed i mean obvious that we have some problems need to be fixed but they're fixable that's really beautifully put that is a really hopeful idea that nature that life even human civilization is resilient to all the mistakes we make so the roots are there so it outlives us it's patient with our adolescent fuck-ups i mean we're a thin layer on the crust and you know eventually the earth will be swallowed by the sun and humans won't it will have long gone extinct by then um but yeah there's all kinds around grounds for hope uh so us being a thin layer of crust what do you think is the meaning of this layer what's the meaning of human existence what's the meaning of life well i think it depends who you're talking to if you're talking to a raccoon it might be one thing if you're talking to an growth tree it's making sure you're straight up upright and not you know on a slippery slope of fish yeah fish i guess they're trying to avoid the hook yeah right no fish ever when they take the bait no fish in the world has ever said i hope i get hooked um and that's that's one of the problems with tobacco is that there's all this bait and people get hooked but uh you know the fish don't have heads we have heads one of the great innovations in the history of humanity going back way priming is the invention of the head the mobile head that turns and sees you know and the fish didn't have that you know they didn't have hands the octopus kept cool stuff yeah um it's not all about the head it's not all about the head well in fact the octopus basically they've got brains in their fingers and maybe brains is not even that good of an invention and the long arc of history because the fish maybe got it right [Laughter] stay in the ocean well of course we evolved from fish so yeah but uh we moved on is there a why to this uh or is it just the way it's it's like the current it's just it's just like these pockets of interesting complexity pops up like like allah showing up on a rock this is what human civilization is this weird little thing that showed up on a rock and then it'll disappear well we are probably the most remarkable creation that nature has ever belched forward we're probably the only one if you don't count the kt meteorite that just almost destroyed the earth we're the only ones that can really have the capacity to destroy the earth i'm fascinated by the meteorite that wiped out everything bigger than four feet long you know the the mount everest size meteorite that hit the earth 66 million years ago and destroyed most species in in the water and on land there could have been some smart folks around then too well actually one thing i like to think about is that 232.3 million years ago and 230 2.4 million years ago that's a hundred thousand years that tiniest of a sliver maybe a millimeter in most parts of the earth it's enough time for a species of dinosaur to become intelligent build a civilization and go extinct with no traces and uh maybe that happened our ignorance can fully engulf the fact that that happened oh there's the beautiful self-importance of us of us humans it's easy to forget that multiple intelligent civilizations could have lived on earth it's possible and gone extinct or even life may have evolved more than once not only that but it proto-life may still exist and we were not even looking for it you know some type of clay that became life may still exist and people one thing i like to think about is is always what is the before time that is now i remember lecturing about this right before kovat and it's sort of like what is the what is the our world now that we'll say what was it like to be then before yeah before and that's the world we live in we live in a before time for something we really can't predict probably physical uh you know appendages and you know and being in person being able to touch each other or wanting to touch each other versus being in the digital world right this whole idea of the metaverse and more and more moving into a digital space what was it like being born before most of your your life wasn't on the computer yeah um it's pretty damn good for the record but maybe i don't know the alternative robert this is a fascinating conversation thank you for taking us through some dark periods of human history but i think they contain a lot of lessons for today that science is often inextricably connected to our values to our ethics to our politics and that's something we have to contend with so your work is really important and thank you for shining a light on it thank you thanks for listening to this conversation with robert proctor to support this podcast please check out our sponsors in the description and now let me leave you with some words from carl sagan somewhere something incredible is waiting to be known thank you for listening and hope to see you next time you
