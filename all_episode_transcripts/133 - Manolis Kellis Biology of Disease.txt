this podcast as a side note let me say that biology in the brain and in the various systems of the body fill me with awe every time i think about how such a chaotic mess coming from its humble origins in the ocean was able to achieve such incredibly complex and robust mechanisms of life that survived despite all the forces of nature that want to destroy it it is so unlike the computing systems we humans have engineered that it makes me feel that in order to create artificial general intelligence and artificial consciousness we may have to completely rethink how we engineer computational systems if you enjoy this thing subscribe on youtube review it with five stars in apple podcast follow on spotify support on patreon or connect with me on twitter at lex friedman and now here's my conversation with manolis kalis so your group at mit is trying to understand the molecular basis of human disease what are some of the biggest challenges in your view don't get me started i mean irregularities standing human disease is the most complex challenge in modern science so because human disease is as complex as the human genome it is as complex as the human brain and it is in many ways even more complex because the more we understand disease complexity the more we start understanding genome complexity and epigenome complexity and brain circuitry complexity and immune system complexity and cancer complexity and so on and so forth so traditionally human disease was following basic biology you would basically understand basic biology and model organisms like you know mouse and fly and yeast you would understand sort of mammalian biology and animal biology and eukaryotic biology in sort of progressive layers of complexity getting closer to human phylogenetically and you would do perturbation experiments in those species to see if i knock out a gene what happens and based on the knocking out of these genes you would basically then have a way to drive human biology because you would you would sort of understand the functions of these genes and then if you find that a human gene locus something that you've mapped from human genetics to that gene is related to a particular human disease you say now i know the function of the gene from the model organisms i can now go and understand the function of that gene in human but this is all changing this is dramatically changed so that that was the old way of doing basic biology you would start with the animal models the eukaryotic models the mammalian models and then you would go to human human genetics has been so transformed in the last decade or two that human genetics is now actually driving the basic biology there is more genetic mutation information in the human genome than there will ever be in any other species what do you mean by mutation information so perturbations is how you understand systems so an engineer builds systems and then they know how they work from the inside out a scientist studies systems through perturbations you basically say if i poke that balloon what's going to happen and i'm going to film it in super high resolution understand i don't know aerodynamics or fluid dynamics if it's filled with water etc so you can then make experimentation by perturbation and then the scientific process is sort of building models that best fit the data designing new experiments that best test your models and challenge your models and so forth that's the same thing with science basically if you're trying to understand biological science you basically want to do perturbations that then drive the models so how do these perturbations allow you to understand disease so if if you know that a gene is related to disease you don't want to just know that it's related to the disease you want to know what is the disease mechanism because you want to go and intervene so the way that i like to describe it is that traditionally epidemiology which is basically the study of disease you know sort of the observational study of disease has been about correlating one thing with another thing so if you if you have a lot of people with liver disease who are also alcoholics you might say well maybe the alcoholism is driving the liver disease or maybe those who have liver disease self-medicate with alcohol so that the connection could be either way with genetic epidemiology it's about correlating changes in the genome with phenotypic differences and then you know the direction of causality so if you know that a particular gene is related to the disease you can basically say okay perturbing that gene in mouse causes the mice to have x phenotype so perturbing that gene in human causes the humans to have the disease so i can now figure out what are the detailed molecular phenotypes in the human that are related to that organismal phenotype in the disease so it's all about understanding disease mechanism understanding what are the pathways what are the tissues what are the processes that are associated with the disease so that we know how to intervene you can then prescribe particular medications that also alter these processes you can prescribe lifestyle changes that also affect these processes and so forth that's such a beautiful puzzle to try to solve like what kind of perturbations eventually have this ripple effect that leads to disease across the population and then you study that for animals a mice first and then see how that might possibly connect to humans how hard is that puzzle of trying to figure out how little perturbations might lead to in a stable way to a disease in animals we make the puzzle simpler because we perturb one gene at a time that's the beauty of it's the power of animal models you can basically decouple the perturbations you only do one perturbation and you only do strong perturbations at a time in human the puzzle is incredibly complex because i mean obviously you don't do human experimentation you wait for natural selection and natural genetic variation to basically do its own experiments which it has been doing for hundreds and thousands of years in the human population and for hundreds of thousands of years across you know the the history leading to the human population so you basically take this natural genetic variation that we all carry within us every one of us carries six million perturbations so i've done six million experiments on you six million experiments for me six million experiments on every one of seven billion people on the planet what's the six million correspond to six million unique genetic variants that are segregating the human population every one of us carries millions of polymorphic sites poly many morph forms polymorphic means many forms variants that basically means that every one of us has single nucleotide alterations that we have inherited from mom and from that that basically can be thought of as tiny little perturbations most of them don't do anything but some of them lead to all of the phenotypic differences that we see between us the reason why two twins are identical is because these variants completely determine the way that i'm going to look at exactly 93 years of age how happy are you with this kind of data set is it uh large enough of the human population of earth is that too big too small yeah so so the the is it is it large enough is a power analysis question and in every one of our grants we do a power analysis based on what is the effect size that i would like to detect and what is the natural variation in the two forms so every time you do a perturbation you're asking i'm changing form a into for b form a has some natural genetic vary some natural phenotypic variation around it and form b has some natural phenotypic variation around it if those variances are large and the differences between the mean of a and the mean of b are small then you have very little power the further the means go apart that's the effect size the more power you have and the smaller the standard deviation the more power you have so basically when you're asking is that sufficiently large certainly not for everything but we already have enough power for many of the stronger effects in the more tight distributions so that's a hopeful message that there exists parts of the genome that that have a strong effect that has a small variance that's exactly right unfortunately those perturbations are the basis of disease in many cases so it's not a you know hopeful message sometimes it's a terrible message it's basically well some people are sick but if when if we can figure out what are these contributors to sickness we can then help make them better and help many other people better who don't carry that exact mutation but who carry mutations on the same pathways and that's what we like to call the allelic series of a gene you basically have many perturbations of the same gene in different people each with a different frequency in the human population and each with a different effect on the individual charism so you said uh in the past there would be these small experiments on perturbations and animal models what does this puzzle solving process look like today so we basically have you know something like seven billion people in the planet and every one of them carries something like six million mutations you basically have an enormous matrix of genotype by phenotype by systematically measuring the phenotype of these individuals and the traditional way of measuring this phenotype has been to look at one trait at a time you would gather families and you would sort of paint the pedigrees of a strong effect what we like to call mendelian mutation so a mutation that gets transmitted in a dominant or a recessive but strong effect form where basically one locus plays a very big role in that disease and you could then look at carriers versus non-carriers in one family carries versus non-carriers in another family and do that for hundreds sometimes thousands of families and then trace these inheritance patterns and then figure out what is the gene that plays that role is this the matrix that you're showing in in talks or lectures so that matrix is the input to the stuff that i saw in talks so basically that matrix has traditionally been strong effect genes what the matrix looks like now is instead of pedigrees instead of families you basically have thousands and sometimes hundreds of thousands of unrelated individuals each with all of their genetic variants and each with their phenotype for example height or lipids or you know whether they're sick or not for a particular trait that has been the modern view instead of going to families going to unrelated individuals with one phenotype at a time and what we're doing now as we're maturing in all of these sciences is that we're doing this in the context of large medical systems or enormous cohorts that are very well phenotyped across hundreds of phenotypes sometimes with our complete electronic health record so you can now start relating not just one gene segregating one family not just thousands of variants segregating with one phenotype but now you can do millions of variants versus hundreds of phenotypes and as a computer scientist i mean deconvolving that matrix partitioning it into the layers of biology that are associated with every one of these elements is a dream come true it's it's like the world's greatest puzzle and you can now solve that puzzle by throwing in more and more knowledge about the function of different genomic regions and how these functions are changed across tissues and in the context of disease and that's what my group and many other groups are doing we're trying to systematically relate this genetic variation with molecular variation at the expression level of the genes at the epigenomic level of the gene regulatory circuitry and at the cellular level of what are the functions that are happening in those cells at the single cell level using single cell profiling and then relate all that vast amount of knowledge computationally with the thousands of traits that each of these of thousands of variants are perturbing i mean this is something we talked about i think last time so there's these effects at different levels that happen you said at a single cell level you're trying to see things that happen due to certain perturbations and then so it's not just like a puzzle of um perturbation and disease it's perturbation then effect at a cellular level at an organ level a body like how do you disassemble this into like what your group is working on you're basically taking a bunch of the hard problems in the space how do you break apart a difficult disease uh and break it apart into problems that you into puzzles that you can now start solving so there's a struggle here computer scientists love hard puzzles and they're like oh i want to you know build a method that just deconvolves the whole thing computationally and you know that's very tempting and it's very appealing but biologists just like to decouple that complexity experimentally to just like peel off layers of complexity experimentally and that's what many of these modern tools that you know my group and others have both developed and used the fact that we can now figure out tricks for peeling off these layers of complexity by testing one cell type at a time or by testing one cell at a time and you could basically say what is the effect of this genetic variant associated with alzheimer's on human brain human brain sounds like oh it's an organ of course just go one organ at a time but human brain has of course dozens of different brain regions and within each of these brain regions dozens of different cell types and every single type of neuron every single type of glial cell between astrocytes oligodendrocytes microglia between you know all of the neural cells and the vascular cells and the immune cells that are co-inhabiting the the brain between the different types of excitatory and inhibitory neurons that are sort of interacting with each other between different layers of neurons in the cortical layers every single one of these has a different type of function to play in cognition in interaction with the environment in maintenance of the brain in energetic needs in feeding the brain with blood with oxygen in clearing out the debris that are resulting from the super high energy production of cognition in in humans so all of these things are basically um potentially deconvolvable computationally but experimentally you can just do single cell profiling of dozens of regions of the brain across hundreds of individuals across millions of cells and then now you have pieces of the puzzle that you can then put back together to understand that complexity i mean first of all i mean the human brain the cells in the human brain are the most okay maybe i'm romanticizing it but cognition seems to be very complicated so uh separating into the function breaking alzheimer's down to the cellular level seems very challenging is that basically you're trying to find a way that some perturbation and genome results in some obvious major dysfunction in the cell you're trying to find something like that exactly so so what does human genetics do human genetics basically looks at the whole path from genetic variation all the way to disease so human genetics has basically taken thousands of alzheimer's cases and thousands of controls matched for age for sex for you know environmental backgrounds and so forth and then looked at that map where you're asking what are the individual genetic persuasions and how are they related to all the way to alzheimer's disease and that has actually been quite successful so we now have you know more than 27 different loci these are genomic regions that are associated with alzheimer's at this end-to-end level but the moment you sort of break up that very long path into smaller levels you can basically say from genetics what are the epigenomic alterations at the level of gene regulatory elements where that genetic variant perturbs the control region nearby that effect is much larger you mean much larger in terms of this down the line impact or it's much larger in terms of the measurable effect this a versus b variance is actually so much cleanly defined when you go to the shorter branches because for one genetic variant to affect alzheimer's that's a very long path that basically means that in the context of millions of these six million variants that every one of us carries that one single nucleotide has a detectable effect all the way to the end i mean it's just mind-boggling that that's even possible but indeed yeah but indeed there are such effects so the hope is or the most scientifically speaking the the most effective place where to detect the alteration that results in disease is earlier on in the pipeline as early as possible it's it's a trade-off if you go very early on in the pipeline now each of these epigenomic alterations for example this enhancer control region is active maybe 50 less which is a dramatic effect now you can ask well how much does changing one regulatory region in the genome in one cell type change disease well that path is now long so if you instead look at expression the path between genetic variation the expression of one gene goes through many enhancer regions and therefore it's a subtler effect at the gene level but then now you're closer because one gene is acting on you know in the context of only 20 000 other genes as opposed to one enhancer acting in the context of two million other enhancers so you basically now have genetic epigenomic the circuitry transcriptomic the gene expression level and then cellular where you can basically say i can measure various properties of those cells what is the calcium influx rate when i have this genetic variation what is the synaptic density what is the electric impulse conductivity and so on so forth so you can measure things along this path to disease and you can also measure endophenotypes you can basically measure you know your brain activity you can do imaging in the brain you can basically measure i don't know the heart rate the pulse the lipids the amount of blood secreted and so forth and then through all of that you can basically get at the path to causality the path to disease and is there something beyond cellular so you mentioned lifestyle interventions or changes as a way to or like be able to prescribe changes in life style like what what about organs what about like the function of the body as a whole yeah absolutely so basically when you go to your doctor they always measure you know your pulse they always measure your height those measure your weight your you know your bmis basically these are just very basic variables but with digital devices nowadays you can start measuring hundreds of variables for every individual you can basically also phenotype cognitively through tests uh alzheimer's patients there are cognitive tests that you can imagine that you that you typically do for uh cognitive decline these minimental you know observations that that you have specific questions too you can think of sort of enlarging the set of cognitive tests so in the mouse for example you do experiments for how do they get out of mazes how do they find food whether they recall a fear whether they shake in a new environment and so forth in the human you can have much much richer phenotypes where you can basically say not just imaging at the you know organ level but and all kinds of other activities at the organ level but you can also do at the organism level you can do behavioral tests and how did they do on empathy how did they do on memory how did they do on long-term memory versus short-term memory and so forth i love how you're calling that phenotype i guess it is it is but like your behavior patterns that might change over over uh over a period of a life it's yeah your ability to remember things your ability to be yeah empathetic or emotionally your intelligence perhaps even yeah but intelligence has hundreds of variables you can be your math intelligence your literary intelligence your puzzle-solving intelligence your logic it could be like hundreds of things and all of that is it's we were able to measure that better and better so and all that could be connected to the entire pipeline we used to think of each of these as a single variable like intelligence i mean that's ridiculous it's basically dozens of different genes that are controlling every single variable you can basically think of you know imagine us in a video game where every one of us has measures of you know strength stamina you know energy left and so forth but you could click on each of those like five bars that are just the main bars and each of those will just give you then hundreds of bars yeah and you can basically say okay great for my you know machine learning task i want someone who i'm a human who has these particular forms of intelligence i require now these you know 20 different things and then you can combine those things and then relate them to of course performance in a particular task but you can also relate them to genetic variation that might be affecting different parts of the brain for example your frontal cortex versus your temporal cortex versus your visual cortex and so forth so genetic variation that affects expression of genes in different parts of your brain can basically affect your you know music ability your auditory ability your smell your you know just dozens of different phenotypes can be broken down into you know hundreds of cognitive variables and then relate each of those to thousands of genes that are associated with them so somebody who loves rpgs role-playing games there's uh there's too few variables that we can control so i'm excited if we're in fact living in a simulation and this is a video game i'm excited by the quality of of the video game the the the the game designer did a hell of a good job so we're impressed oh i don't know the sunset last night was a little unrealistic yeah yeah the graphics exactly come on nvidia to zoom back out we've been talking about the genetic origins of diseases but i think it's fascinating to talk about what are the most important diseases to understand and especially as it connects to the things that you're working on so it's very difficult to think about important diseases to understand there's many metrics of importance one is lifestyle impact i mean if you look at kovid the impact on lifestyle has been enormous so understanding kovid is important because it has impacted the well-being in terms of ability to have a job ability to have an apartment ability to go to work ability to have a mental circle of support and all of that for you know millions of americans like huge huge impact so that's one aspect of importance so basically mental disorders alzheimer's has a huge importance in the well-being of americans whether or not it die it kills someone for many many years it has a huge impact so the first measure of importance is just well-being like impact on the quality of life impact on the quality of life absolutely the second metric which is much easier to quantify is deaths what is the number one killer the number one killer is actually heart disease it is actually killing 650 000 americans per year number two is cancer with 600 000 americans number three far far down the list is accidents every single accident combined so basically you you know you read the news accidents like you know there was a huge car crash all over the news but the number of deaths number three by far 167 000 lower respiratory disease so that's asthma not being able to breathe and so forth 160 000 alzheimer's number four number five with 000 and then stroke brain aneurysms and so forth that's 147 000 diabetes and metabolic disorders etc that's 85 000. the flu is 60 000 suicide 50 000 and then overdose et cetera you know goes further down the list so of course kovit has creeped up to be the number three killer this year with you know more than 100 000 americans and counting um and you know but but if you think about sort of what do we use what are the most important diseases you have to understand both the quality of life and the the sheer number of deaths and just numbers of years lost if you wish and and uh each of these diseases you can think of as uh and also including terrorist attacks and school shootings for example things which lead to fatalities you can look at as problems that could be solved and some problems are harder to solve than others i mean that's part of the equation so maybe if you look at these diseases if you look at heart disease or cancer or alzheimer's or just like schizophrenia and obesity w like not necessarily things that kill you but affect the quality of life which problems are solvable which aren't which are harder to solve which aren't i love your question because it puts it in the context of a global um effort rather than just a local effort so basically if you look at the global aspect exercise and nutrition are two interventions that we can as a society make a much better job at so if you think about sort of the availability of cheap food it's extremely high in calories it's extremely detrimental for you like a lot of processed food etc so if we change that equation and as a society we made availability of healthy food much much easier and charged a burger at mcdonald's the price that it costs on the health system then people would actually start buying more healthy foods so basically that's sort of a societal intervention if you wish in the same way increasing empathy increasing education increasing the social framework and support would basically lead to fewer suicides it would lead to fewer murders it would lead to fewer you know deaths overall so you know that's something that we as a society can do you can you can also think about external factors versus internal factors so the external factors are basically communicable diseases like covid like the flu etc and the internal factors are basically things like you know cancer and alzheimer's where basically your your genetics will eventually you know drive you there um and then of course with all of these factors every single disease has both a genetic component and environmental component so heart disease you know huge then they contribute contribution alzheimer's it's like you know 60 plus genetic so i think it's like 79 heritability so that basically means that genetics alone explains 79 of alzheimer's incidence and yes there's a 21 environmental component where you could basically enrich your cognitive environment enrich your social interactions read more books learn a foreign language go running you know sort of have a more fulfilling life all of that will actually decrease alzheimer's but there's a limit to how much that that can impact because of the huge genetic footprint so this is fascinating so each one of these problems have a genetic component and an environment component and so like when there's a genetic component what can we do about some of these diseases what what have you worked on what can you say that's uh in terms of problems that are solvable here or understandable so my group works on the genetic component but i would argue that understanding the genetic component can have a huge impact even on the environmental component why is that because genetics gives us access to mechanism and if we can alter the mechanism if we can impact the mechanism we can perhaps counteract some of the environmental components interesting so understanding the biological mechanisms leading to disease is extremely important in being able to intervene but when you can intervene what you know the analogy that i like to gay to give is for example for obesity you know think of it as a giant bathtub of fat there's basically fat coming in from your diet and there's fat coming out from your exercise okay that's an in out equation and that's the equation that everybody's focusing on but your metabolism impacts that you know bathtub basically your metabolism controls the rate at which you're burning energy it controls away the rate at which you're storing energy and it also teaches you about the various valves that control the input and the output equation so if we can learn from the genetics the valves we can then manipulate those valves and even if the environment is feeding you a lot of fat and getting a little that out you just poke another hole at the bathtub and just get a lot of the fat out yeah that's fascinating yeah so that we're not just passive observers of our genetics the more we understand the more we can come up with actual treatments and i think that's an important uh aspect to realize when people are thinking about strong effect versus weak effect variants so some variants have strong effects we talked about these mendelian disorders where a single gene has a sufficiently large effect pen and trans expressivity and so so forth that basically you can um trace it in families with cases and not cases cases not cases and so forth but even the you know but so so these are the genes that everybody says oh that's the genes we should go after because that's a strong effect gene i like to think about it slightly differently these are the genes where genetic impacts that have a strong effect were tolerated because every single time we have a genetic association with disease it depends on two things number one the obvious one whether the gene has an impact on the disease number two the more subtle one is whether there is genetic in variation standing and circulating and segregating in the human population that impacts that gene some genes are so darn important that if you mess with them even a tiny little amount that person is dead so those genes don't have variation you're not going to find the genetic association if you don't have variation that doesn't mean that the gene has no role it's simply that the gene it simply means that the gene tolerates no mutations so that's actually a strong signal when there's no variation that's so fast exactly genes that have very little variation are hugely important you can actually rank the importance of genes based on how little variation they have and those genes that have very little variation but no association with disease that's a very good metric to say oh that's probably a developmental gene because we're not good at measuring those phenotypes so it's genes that you can tell evolution has excluded mutations from but yet we can't see them associated with anything that we can measure nowadays it's probably early embryonic lethal what are all the words you just said earlier in brionic what lethal meaning meaning that if you don't have it okay there's a bunch of stuff that um is required for a stable functional organism exactly across the board for our entire for for entire species i guess if you look at sperm it expresses thousands of proteins does sperm actually need thousands of proteins no but it's probably just testing them so my speculation is that misfolding of these proteins is an early test for failure so that out of the you know millions of sperm that are possible you select the subset that are just not grossly misfolding thousands of proteins so it's kind of an assert uh that this is followed correctly correct yeah this uh just uh because if this little thing about the folding of a protein is incorrect that probably means somewhere down the line there's a bigger issue that's exactly right so fail fast so basically if you look at the mammalian investment in a new born that investment is enormous in terms of resources so mammals have basically evolved mechanisms for fail fast where basically in those early months of development i mean it's it's horrendous of course at the personal level when you lose a uh you know your future child but in some ways there's so little hope for that child to develop and sort of make it through the remaining months that sort of fail fast is probably a good evolutionary principle from an evolutionary perspective for mammals and of course humans have a lot of medical resources that you can sort of give those children a chance and you know we have so much more success in sort of giving folks who have these strong carrier mutations a chance but if they're not even making it through the first three months we're not going to see them so that's why when we when we say what are the most important genes to focus on the ones that have a strong effect mutation or the ones that have a weak effect mutation well you know the jury might be out because the ones that have a strong effect mutation are basically you know not mattering as much the ones that only have weak effect mutations by understanding through genetics that they have a weak effect mutation and understanding that they have a causal role on the disease we can then say okay great evolution has only tolerated a two percent change in that gene pharmaceutically i can go in and induce a 70 change in that gene and maybe i will poke another hole at the bathtub that was not easy to control in you know many of the other sort of strong effect genetic variants so okay so there's this beautiful map of uh across the population of things that you're saying strong and weak effects so stuff with a lot of mutations and stuff with little mutations with no mutations and you have this map and it's it lays out the puzzle yeah so so when i say strong effect i mean at the level of individual mutations so so basically genes where so so you have to think of first the effect of the gene on the disease remember how i was sort of painting that map earlier from genetics all the way to phenotype that gene can have a strong effect on the disease but the genetic variant might have a weak effect on the gene so basically when you ask what is the effect of that genetic variant on the disease it could be that that genetic variant impacts the gene by a lot and then the gene impacts the disease by a little or it could be that the genetic variant impacts the gene by a little and then the gene impacts the disease by a lot so what we care about is genes that impact the disease a lot but genetics gives us the full equation and what i would argue is if we couple the genetics with expression variation to basically ask what genes change by a lot and you know which genes correlate with disease by a lot even if the genetic variants change them by a little then that those are the best places to intervene those are the best places where pharmaceutically if i have even a modest effect i will have a strong effect on the disease whereas those genetic variants that have a huge effect on the disease i might not be able to change that gene by this much without affecting all kinds of other things interesting so yeah okay so that's what we're looking at then what have we been able to find in terms of which disease could be helped again don't get me started this is um we have found so much our understanding of disease has changed so dramatically with genetics i mean places that we had no idea would be involved so one of the worst things about my genome is that i have a genetic predisposition to age-related macular degeneration amd so it's a form of blindness that causes you to to lose the central part of your vision progressively as you grow older my increased risk is fairly small i have an eight percent chance you only have a six percent chance you i'm on average yeah by the way when you say my you mean literally yours you know this about you i know this about me yeah which is kind of uh i mean uh philosophically speaking is a pretty powerful thing so to live with i mean maybe that's uh so we agreed to talk again by the way for the listeners to where we're going to try to focus on science today and a little bit of philosophy next time but it's uh interesting to think about the more you're able to know about yourself from the genetic information in terms of the diseases how that changes your own view of life yeah so there's there's a lot of impact there and there's a something called genetic exceptionalism which basically thinks of genetics as something very very different than everything else as a type of determinism and um you know let's talk about that next time so basically it's a good preview yeah so let's go back to amd so basically with amd we have no idea what causes amd you know it was it was a mystery until the genetics were worked out and now the fact that i know that i have a predisposition allows me to sort of make some life choices number one but number two the genes that lead to that predisposition give us insights as to how does it actually work and that's a place where genetics gave us something totally unexpected so there's a complement pathway which is an immune function pathway that was in you know most of the loci associated with amd and that basically told us that wow there's an immune basis to this eye disorder that people had just not expected before if you look at complement it was recently also implicated in schizophrenia and there's a type of microglia that is involved in synaptic pruning so synapses are the connections between neurons and in this whole use it or lose it view of mental cognition and other capabilities you basically have uh microglia which are immune cells that are sort of constantly traversing your brain and then pruning neuronal connections pruning synaptic connections that are not utilized so in schizophrenia there's thought to be a change in the pruning that basically if you don't prune your synapses the right way you will actually have an increased role of schizophrenia this is something that was completely unexpected for schizophrenia of course we knew it has to do with neurons but the role of the complement complex which is also implicated in amd which is now also implicating schizophrenia was a huge surprise what's the complement complex so it's basically a set of genes the complement genes that are basically having various immune roles and as i was saying earlier our immune system has been co-opted for many different roles across the body so they actually play many diverse roles and somehow the immune system is connected to the synaptic pruning process exact process exactly so immune cells were co-opted to prune synapses how did you figure this out how does one go about figuring this intricate connection uh like pipeline of connections out yeah let me give you another example so so alzheimer's disease the first place that you would expect it to act is obviously the brain so we had basically this roadmap epigenomics consortium view of the human epigenome the largest map of the human epigenome that has ever been built across 127 different tissues and samples with dozens of epigenomic marks measured in you know hundreds of donors so what we've basically learned through that is that you you basically can map what are the active gene regulatory elements for every one of the tissues in the body and then we connected these gene regulatory active maps of basically what regions of the human genome are turning on in every one of different tissues we then can go back and say where are all the genetic loci that are associated with disease this is something that my group i think was the first to do back in 2010 in this ernst nature biotech paper but basically we were for the first time able to show that specific chromatin states specific epigenomic states in that case enhancers were in fact enriched enriched in disease associated variants we pushed that further in the ernst nature paper a year later and then in this roadmap epigenomics paper you know a few years after that but basically that matrix that you mentioned earlier was in fact the first time that we could see what genetic traits have genetic variants that are enriched in what tissues in the body and a lot of that map made complete sense if you looked at a diversity of immune traits like allergies and type 1 diabetes and so forth you basically could see that they were enriching that the genetic variants associated with those traits were enriched in enhancers in these gene regulatory elements active in t cells and b cells and hematopoietic stem cells and so forth so that basically gave us a confirmation in many ways that those immune traits were instead indeed enriching immune cells if you look if you if you looked at type 2 diabetes you basically saw an enrichment in only one type of sample and it was pancreatic eyelids and we know that type 2 diabetes in you know sort of stems from the dysregulation of insulin in the beta cells of pancreatic eyelids and that sort of was you know spot on super precise if you looked at blood pressure where would you expect blood pressure to occur you know i don't know maybe in your metabolism in ways that you process coffee or something like that maybe in your brain the way that you stress out increases your blood pressure etc what we found is that blood pressure localized specifically in the left ventricle of the heart so the enhancers of the left technology in the heart contain a lot of genetic variants associated with blood pressure if you look at height we found an enrichment specifically in embryonic stem cell enhancers so the genetic variants predisposing you to be taller or shorter are in fact acting in developmental stem cells makes complete sense if you looked at inflammatory bowel disease you basically found inflammatory which is immune and also bowel disease which is digestive and indeed we saw a double enrichment both in the immune cells and in the digestive cells so that basically told us that this is acting in both components there's an immune component to inflammatory bowel disease and there's a digestive component and the big surprise was for alzheimer's we had seven different brain samples we found zero enrichment in the brain samples for genetic variants associated with alzheimer's and this is mind-boggling our brains were literally hurting what is going on and what is going on is that the brain samples are primarily neurons oligodendrocytes and astrocytes in terms of the cell types that make them up so that basically indicated that genetic variants associated with alzheimer's were probably not acting in oligodendrocytes astrocytes or neurons so what could they be acting in well the fourth major cell type is actually microglia microglia are resident immune cells in your brain oh nice the immune oh wow and they are cd14 plus which is this sort of cell surface markers uh of those cells so their cd14 plus cells just like macrophages that are circulating in your blood the microglia are resident monocytes that are basically sitting in your brain they're tissue-specific monocytes and every one of your tissues like your your fat for example has a lot of macrophages that are resin and the m1 versus m2 macrophage ratio has a huge role to play in obesity and you know so basically again these immune cells are everywhere but basically what we found through this completely unbiased view of what are the tissues that likely underlie different disorders we found that alzheimer's was humongously enriched in microglia but not at all in the other cell types so what what are we supposed to make that if you look at the tissues involved is that simply useful for indication of uh propensity for disease or does it give us somehow a pathway of treatment it's very much the second if you look at the um the way to therapeutics you have to start somewhere what are you gonna do you're gonna basically make assays that manipulate those genes and those pathways in those cell types so before we know the tissue of action we don't even know where to start we basically are at a loss but if you know the tissue of action and even better if you know the pathway of action then you can basically screen your small molecules not for the gene you can screen them directly for the pathway in that cell type so you can basically develop a high throughput multiplexed you know robotic system for testing the impact of your favorite molecules that you know are safe efficacious and you know sort of hit that particular gene and so forth you can basically screen those molecules against either a set of genes that act in that pathway or on the pathway directly by having a cellular assay and then you can basically go into mice and do experiments and basically sort of figure out ways to manipulate these processes that allow you to then to go back to humans and do a clinical trial that basically says okay i was able indeed to reverse these processes in mice can i do the same thing in humans so that the the knowledge of the tissues gives you the pathway to treatment but that's not the only part there are many additional steps to figuring out the mechanism of disease i mean so that's really promising maybe uh to take a small step back you've you've mentioned all these puzzles that were figured out with the nature paper for i mean you've mentioned a ton of diseases from obesity to alzheimer's even schizophrenia i think you mentioned and just what is the actual methodology of figuring this out so indeed i mentioned a lot of diseases and and my lab works on a lot of different disorders and the reason for that is that if you look at the if you look at biology it used to be you know zoology departments in both technology departments and you know virology departments and so on so forth and mit was one of the first schools to basically create a biology department like oh we're going to study all of life suddenly why was that even the case because the advent of dna and the genome and the central dogma of dna makes rna mixed protein in many ways unified biology you could suddenly study the process of transcription in viruses or in bacteria and have a huge impact on yeast and fly and maybe even mammals because of this realization of these common underlying processes and in the same way that dna unified biology genetics is unifying disease studies so you used to have um you used to have uh you know i don't know um cardiovascular disease department and uh you know neurological disease department and neurodegeneration department and uh you know um basically immune and cancer and so forth and all of these were studied in different labs you know because it made sense because basically the first step was understanding how the tissue functions and we kind of knew the tissues involved in cardiovascular disease and so forth but what's happening with human genetics is that all of that all of these walls and edifices that we had built are crumbling and the reason for that is that genetics is in many ways revealing unexpected connections so suddenly we now have to bring the immunologists to work on alzheimer's they were never in the room they were in another building altogether the same way for schizophrenia we now have to sort of worry about all these interconnected aspects for metabolic disorders we're finding contributions from brain so suddenly we have to call the neurologist from the other building and so forth so in my view it makes no sense anymore to basically say oh i'm a geneticist studying immune disorders i mean that's that's ridiculous because i mean yeah of course in many ways you still need to sort of focus but what what what we're doing is that we're basically saying we'll go wherever the genetics takes us and by building these massive resources by working on our latest map is now 833 tissues sort of the the next generation of the epigenomics roadmap which we're now called epimap is 833 different tissues and using those we've basically found enrichments in 540 different disorders those enrichments are not like oh great you guys work on that and we'll work on this they're intertwined amazingly so of course there's a lot of modularity but there's these enhancers that are sort of broadly active and these disorders that are broadly active so basically some enhancers are active in on tissues and some disorders are enriching in all tissues so basically there's these multifactorial and this other class which i like to call polyfactorial diseases which are basically lighting up everywhere and in many ways it's you know sort of cutting across these walls that were previously built across these departments and the polyfactorial ones were probably the previous structure departments wasn't equipped to deal with those i mean again maybe it's a romanticized question but you know there's in physics there's a theory of everything do you think it's possible to move towards an almost theory of everything of disease from a genetic perspective so if this unification continues is it possible that like do you think in those terms like trying to arrive at a fundamental understanding of how disease emerges period that unification is not just foreseeable it's inevitable i see it as inevitable we have to go there you cannot be a specialist anymore if you're a genomicist you have to be a specialist in every single disorder and the reason for that is that the fundamental understanding of the circuitry of the human genome that you need to solve schizophrenia that fundamental circuitry is hugely important to solve alzheimer's and that same circuitry is hugely important to solve metabolic disorders and that same exact circuitry is uh hugely important for solving immune disorders and cancer and you know every single disease so all of them have the same sub task and i teach dynamic programming in my class dynamic program is all about sort of not re doing the work it's reusing the work that you do once so basically for us to say oh great you know you guys in the immune building go solve the fundamental circuitry of everything and then you guys in the schizophrenia building go solve the fundamental circuitry of everything separately is crazy so what we need to do is come together and sort of have a circuitry group the circuitry building that sort of tries to solve the circuitry of everything and then the immune folks who will apply this knowledge to all of the disorders that are associated with immune dysfunction and the schizophrenia folks will basically interact with both the immune folks and with the neuronal folks and all of them will be interacting with the circuitry folks and so forth so that's sort of the current structure of my group if you wish so basically what we're doing is focusing on the fundamental circuitry but at the same time we're the users of our own tools by collaborating with many other labs in every one of these disorders that we mentioned we basically have a heart focus on cardiovascular disease coronary artery disease heart failure and so forth we have an immune focus on several immune disorders we have a cancer focus on metastatic melanoma and immunotherapy response we have a psychiatric disease focus on schizophrenia autism ptsd and other psychiatric disorders we have an alzheimer's and neurodegeneration focus on huntington disease als and you know ad related disorders like frontotemporal dementia and lewy body dementia and of course a huge focus on alzheimer's we have a metabolic focus on the role of exercise and diet and sort of how they're impacting metabolic you know organs across the body and across many different tissues and all of them are interfacing with the circuitry and the reason for that is another computer science principle of eat your own dog food if everybody ate their own dog food dog food would taste a lot better the reason why microsoft excel and word and powerpoint was so important and so successful is because the employees that were working on them were using them for their day-to-day tasks you can't just simply build a circuitry and say here it is guys take the circuitry we're done without being the users of that circuitry because you then go back and because we span the whole spectrum from profiling the epigenome using comparative genomics finding the important nucleotides in the genome building the basic functional map of what are the genes in the human genome what are the gene regulatory elements of the human genome i mean over the years we've written a series of papers on how do you find human genes in the first place using comparative genomes how do you find the motifs that are the building blocks of gene regulation used in comparative genomics how do you then find how these motifs come together and act in specific tissues using epigenomics how do you link regulators to enhancers and enhancers to their target genes using epigenomics and regulatory genomics so through the years we've basically built all this infrastructure for understanding what i like to say every single nucleotide of the human genome and how it acts in every one of the major cell types and tissues of the human body i mean this is no small task this is an enormous task that takes the entire field and that's something that my group has taken on along with many other groups and we have also and that sort of thing sets my group perhaps apart we have also worked with specialists in every one of these disorders to basically further our understanding all the way down to disease and in some cases collaborating with pharma to go all the way down to therapeutics because of our deep deep understanding of that basic circuitry and how it allows us to now improve the circuitry not just treat it as a black box but basically go and say okay we need a better cell type specific wiring that we now have at the tissue specific level so we're focusing on that because we're understanding you know the needs from the disease front so you have a sense of the entire pipeline i mean one maybe you can indulge me one nice question to ask would be how do you from the scientific perspective go from knowing nothing about the disease to going you said uh to go into the entire pipeline and actually have a drug or or a treatment that cures that disease so that's an enormously long path and an enormously great challenge and what i'm trying to argue is that it progresses in stages of understanding rather than one gene at a time the traditional view of biology was you have one postdoc working on this gene and another prosthetic working on that gene and they'll just figure out everything about that gene and that's their job what we've realized is how polygenic the diseases are so we can't have one postdoctoral gene anymore we now have to have these cross-cutting needs and i'm going to describe the path to circuitry along those needs and every single one of these paths we are now doing in parallel across thousands of genes so the first step is you have a genetic association and we talked a little bit about sort of the mendelian path and the polygenic path to that association so the mendelian path was looking through families to basically find gene regions and ultimately genes that are underlying particular disorders the polygenic path is basically looking at unrelated individuals in this giant matrix of genotype by phenotype and then finding hits where a particular variant impacts disease all the way to the end and then we now have a connection not between a gene and a disease but between a genetic region and a disease and that distinction is not understood by most people so i'm going to explain it a little bit more why do do we not have a connection between a gene and a disease but we have a connection between a genetic region and a disease the reason for that is that 93 of genetic variants that are associated with disease don't impact the protein at all so if you look at the human genome there's 20 000 genes there's 3.2 billion nucleotides only 1.5 percent of the genome codes for proteins the other 98.5 does not code for proteins if you now look at where are the disease variants located 93 percent of them fall in that outside the genes portion of course genes are enriched but they're only enriched by a factor of three that means that still 93 of genetic variants fall outside the proteins why is that difficult why is that a problem the problem is that when a variant falls outside the gene you don't know what gene is impacted by that variant you can't just say oh it's near this gene let's just connect that variant to the gene and the reason for that is that the genome circuitry is very often long range so you basically have that genetic variant that could sit in the intron of one gene and an intron is sort of the place between the axons that code for proteins so proteins are split up into exons and introns and every exon codes for a particular subset of amino acids and together they're spliced together and then make the final protein so that genetic variant might be sitting in an intron of a gene it's transcribed with the gene it's processed and then excised but it might not impact this gene at all it might actually impact another gene that's a million nucleotides away so it's just riding along even though it has nothing to do with the with this nearby neighborhood that's exactly right let me give you an example the strongest genetic association with obesity was discovered in this fto gene fat and obesity-associated gene so this fto gene was studied ad nauseum people did tons of experiments on on it they figured out that fto is in fact a rna methylation transferase it basically crea it sort of impacts something that we know that we call the epi transcriptome just like the genome can be modified the transcriptome the transcript of the genes can be modified and we basically said oh great that means that that ap transcriptomics is hugely involved in obesity because that that gene fto is is you know uh clearly where the genetic locus is at my group studied fto in collaboration with you know a wonderful team led by melina klausmitzer and what we found is that this fto locus even though it is associated with obesity does not implicate the fto gene the genetic variant sits in the first intron of the fdo gene but it controls two genes irx3 and ir x5 that are sitting 1.2 million nucleotides away several genes away oh boy uh what am i supposed to feel about that because isn't that like super complicated then uh so so the way that i was introduced at a conference a few years ago was uh and here's manolis kellys who wrote the most depressing paper of 2015 and the reason for that is that the entire pharmaceutical industry was so comfortable that there was a single gene in that locus because in some loci you basically have three dozen genes that are all sitting in the same region of association and you're like gosh which ones of those is it but even that question of which ones of those is it is making the assumption that it is one of those as opposed to some random gene just far far away which is what our paper showed so basically what our paper showed is that you can't ignore the circuitry you have to first figure out the circuitry all of those long-range interactions how every genetic variant impacts the expression of every gene in every tissue imaginable across hundreds of individuals and then you now have one of the building blocks not even all of the building blocks for them going and understanding disease so okay so so embrace the the wholeness of the circuitry correct but what so back to the question of starting knowing nothing to the disease and and going to the treatment so what are the next steps so you basically have to first figure out the tissue and then describe how you figure out the tissue you figure out the tissue by taking all of these non-coding variants that are sitting outside proteins and then figuring out what are the epigenomic enrichments and the reason for that you know thankfully is that there is convergence that the same processes are impacted in different ways by different loci and that's a saving grace for our field the fact that if i look at hundreds of genetic variants associated with alzheimer's they localize in a small number of processes can you clarify why that's helpful so like they show up in the same exact way in the in the specific set of processes yeah so basically there's a small number of biological processes that underlie or at least that play them the biggest role in every disorder so in alzheimer's you basically have you know maybe 10 different types of processes one of them is lipid metabolism one of them is immune cell function one of them is neuronal energetics so these are just a small number of processes but you have multiple lesions multiple genetic perturbations that are associated with those processes so if you look at schizophrenia it's excitatory neuron function it's inhibitory neuron function it's synaptic pruning it's calcium signaling and so forth so when you look at disease genetics you have one hit here and one hit there and one hit there and one hit there completely different parts of the genome but it turns out all of those he hits are calcium signaling proteins oh cool you're like aha that means that calcium signaling is important so those people who are focusing on one doctors at a time cannot possibly see that picture you have to become a genomicist you have to look at the omics the um the holistic picture to understand these enrichments but you mentioned the convergence thing so the the whatever the thing associated with the disease shows up so let me explain convergence yeah convergence is such a beautiful concept so you basically have these four genes that are converging on calcium signaling so that basically means that they are acting each in their own way but together in the same process but now in every one of these loci you have many enhancers controlling each of those genes that's another type of convergence where dysregulation of seven different enhancers might all converge on this regulation of that one gene which then converges on calcium signaling and in each one of those enhancers you might have multiple genetic variants distributed across many different people everyone has their own different mutation but all of these mutations are impacting that enhancer and all of these enhancers are impacting that gene and all of these genes are impacting this pathway and all these pathways are acting in the same tissue and all these tissues are converging together on the same biological process of schizophrenia and and you're saying the saving grace is that that conversion seems to happen for a lot of these diseases for all of them basically that for every single disease that we've looked at we have found an epigenomic enrichment how do you do that you basically have all of the genetic variants associated with the disorder and then you're asking for all of the enhancers active in a particular tissue for 540 disorders we've basically found that indeed there is an enrichment that basically means that there is commonality and from the commonality we can just get insights so to explain in mathematical terms we're basically building an empirical prior we're using a bayesian approach to basically say great all of these variants are equally likely in a particular locus to be important energy so in a genetic locus you basically have a dozen variants that are co-inherited because the way that inheritance works in the human genome is through all of these recombination events during meiosis you basically have you know you you inherit maybe three chromosome three for example in your in your body it's inherited from four different parts one part comes from your dad another part comes from your mom another part comes from your dad and other part comes from your mom so basically the way that it i'm sorry from your mom's mom so you basically have one copy that comes from your dad and one copy that comes from your mom but that copy that you got from your mom is a mixture of her maternal and her paternal chromosome and the copy that you got from your dad is a mixture of his maternal and his paternal chromosome so these break points that happen when chromosomes are lighting up and lining up are basically ensuring through these crossover events they're ensuring that every uh child cell during the process of meiosis where you basically have you know one spermatozoid that basically couples with one oval to basically create one egg to basically create the zygote you basically have half of your genome that comes from that and half of your genome that comes from mom but in order to light up not line them up you basically have these crossover events these crossover events are basically leading to co-inheritance of that entire block coming from the your maternal grandmother and that entire block coming from your mother grand grandfather over many generations these crossover events don't happen randomly there's a protein called prdm9 that basically guides the double-stranded breaks and then leads to these crossovers and that protein has a particular preference to only a small number of hot spots of recombination which then lead to a small number of breaks between these co-inheritance patterns so even though there are six million variants there are six million loci there there's you know this variation is inherited in blocks and every one of these blocks has like two dozen genetic variants that are all associated so in the case of fto it wasn't just one variant it was 89 common variants that were all humongously associated with obesity which ones of those is the important one well if you look at only one locus you have no idea but if you look at many loci you basically say aha all of them are enriching in the same epigenomic map in that particular case it was mesenchymal stem cells so these are the progenitor cells that give rise to your brown fat and your white fat progenitor is like the early on developmental substance so you start from one zygote and that's a totipotent cell type it can do anything you then differ you know that cell divides divides divides and then every cell division is leading to specialization where you now have a mesodermal lineage and ectodermal lineage and endodermal lineage that basically leads to different parts of your day or your body the ectoderm will basically give rise to your skin ecto means outside derm is skin so ectoderm but it also gives rise to your neurons and your whole brain so that's a lot of ectoderm mesoderm gives rise to your internal organs including the vasculature and you know your muscle and stuff like that so you basically have this progressive differentiation and then if you look further further down that lineage you basically have one lineage that will give rise to both your muscle and your bone but also your fat and if you go further down the lineage of your fat you basically have your white fat cells these are the cells that store energy so when you eat a lot but you don't exercise too much there's an excess a set of calories a lot excess energy what you do with those you basically create you spend a lot of that energy to create these high-energy molecules lipids which you can then burn when you need them on a rainy day so that leads to obesity if you don't exercise and if you overeat because your body is like oh great i have all these calories i'm going to store them more calories i'm going to store them too oh more calories and the you know 42 of european chromosomes have a predisposition to storing fat which was selected probably in the you know food scarcity periods like basically as we were exiting africa you know before and during the ice ages you know there was probably a selection to those individuals who made it north to basically be able to store energy you know a lot more energy so you basically now have this lineage that is deciding whether you want to store energy in your white fat or burn energy in your base fat it turns out that your fat is you know we like we we have such a bad view of fat fat is your best friend fat can both store all these excess lipids that would be otherwise circulating through your you know body and causing damage but it can also burn calories directly if you have too much of energy you can just choose to just burn some of that as heat so basically when you're cold you're burning energy to basically warm your body up and you're burning all these lipids and you're burning all these scatters so what we basically found is that across the board genetic variants associated with obesity across many of these regions were all enriched repeatedly in mesenchymal stem cell enhancers so that gave us a hint as to which of these genetic variants was likely driving this whole association and we ended up with this one genetic variant called rs1421085 and that genetic variant out of the 89 was the one that we predicted to be causal for the disease wow so going back to those steps first step is figure out the relevant tissue based on the global enrichment second step is figure out the causal variant among many variants in this linkage disequilibrium in this co-inherited block between these recombination hotspots these boundaries of these inherited blocks that's the second step the third step is once you know that causal variant try to figure out what is the motif that is disrupted by that causal variant basically how does it act variants don't just disrupt elements they disrupt the binding of specific regulators so basically the third step there was how do you find the motif that is responsible like the gene regulatory word the building block of gene regulation that is responsible for that disregulatory event and the fourth step is finding out what regulator normally binds that motif and is now no longer able to bind and then once you have the regulator can you then try to figure out how to what uh after it developed how to fix it that's exactly right you now know how to intervene you have basically a regulator you have a gene that you can then perturb and you say well maybe that regulator has a global role in obesity i can perturb the regulator just to clarify when we say perturb like on the scale of a human life can a human being be helped of course of course yeah so i guess her understanding is the first step no no but perturbed basically means you now develop therapeutics pharmaceutical therapeutics against that or you develop other types of intervention that affect the expression of that gene what do uh pharmaceutical therapeutics look like when your understandings in a genetic level yeah sorry if it's a dumb question no no it's a brilliant question but i want to save it for a little bit later when we start talking about therapeutics perfect we've talked about the first four steps there's two more so basically the first step is figure out i mean the zeroth step the starting point is the genetics the first step after that is figure out the tissue of action the second step is figuring out the nucleotide that is responsible or set of nucleotides the third step is figure out the motif and the upstream regulator number four number five and six is what are the targets so number five is great now i know the regulator i know the motif i know the tissue and i know the variant what does it actually do so you have to now trace it to the biological process and the genes that mediate that biological process so knowing all of this can now allow you to find the target genes how by basically doing perturbation experiments or by looking at the folding of the epigenome or by looking at the genetic impact of that genetic variant on the expression of genes and we use all three so let me go through them basically one of them is physical links this is the folding of the genome onto itself how do you even figure out the folding it's a little bit of a tangent but it's a super awesome technology think of the genome as again this massive packaging that we talked about of taking two meters worth of dna and putting it in something that's a million times smaller than 2 meters worth of dna that's a single cell you basically have this massive packaging and this packaging basically leads to the chromosome being wrapped around in sort of tight ways in ways however that are functionally capable of being reopened and reclosed so i can then go in and figure out that folding by sort of chopping up the spaghetti soup putting glue and ligating the segments that were chopped up but nearby each other and then sequencing through these ligation events to figure out that this region of these chromosomes that region of the chromosome were near each other that means they were interacting even though they were far away on the genome itself so that chopping up sequencing and re-gluing is basically giving you folds of the genome that we said how does cutting it help you figure out which ones were close in the original folding so you have a bowl of noodles go on and in that bowl of noodles some some noodles are near each other yes so throw in a bunch of glue you basically freeze the noodles in place throw in a cutter that chops up the noodles into the little pieces now throw in some ligation enzyme that lets those pieces that were free re-ligate near each other in some cases they re-ligate what you had just got but that's very rare most of the time they will re-ligate in whatever was proximal you now have glued the red noodle that was crossing the blue noodle to each other you then reverse the glue the glue goes away and you just sequence the heck out of it most of the time you'll find red segment with you know red segment but you can specifically select for ligation events that have happened that were not from the same segment by sort of marking a particular way and then selecting those and then your sequencing you look for red with blue matches of sort of things that were glued that were not immediate proximal to each other and that reveals the linking of the blue noodle and the red noodle you're with me so far yeah good so we you know we've done these experiments physical that's the physical that's step one of the physical and what what the physical revealed is topologically associated domains basically big blocks of the genome that are topologically don't you know connected together that's the physical the second one is the genetic links it basically says across individuals that have different genetic variants how are their genes expressed differently remember before i was saying that the path between genetics and disease is enormous but we can break it up to look at the path between genetics and gene expression so instead of using alzheimer's as a phenotype i can now use expression of irx3 as the phenotype expression of gene a and i can look at all of the g all of the humans who contain a g at that location and all the humans will contain a t at that location and basically say wow turns out that the expression of this gene is higher for the t humans than for the g humans at that location so that basically gives me a genetic link between a genetic variant a locus or region and the expression of nearby genes good on the genetic link i think so awesome so the third link is the activity link what's an activity link it basically says if i look across 833 different epigenomes whenever these enhancer is active this gene is active that gives me an activity link between this region of the dna and that gene and then the fourth one is perturbations where i can go in and you know blow up that region and see what are the genes that change in expression or i can go in and over activate that region and see what genes change in expression uh so i guess that's similar to activity yeah yeah so that's basically it's similar to activity i agree but it's causal rather than correlational again i'm i'm a little weird like no no you're 100 on it's exactly the same but the perturbation where i go and intervene yes i basically take a bunch of cells so you know crispr right crispr is this genome guidance and cutting mechanism it's what george like likes to call genome vandalism so you basically are able to one you can basically take a guide rna that you put into the crispr system and the crispr system will basically use this guide rna scan the genome find wherever there's a match and then cut the genome so you know i digress but it's a bacterial immune defense system so basically bacteria are constantly attacked by viruses but sometimes they win against the viruses and they chop up these viruses and remember as a trophy inside their genome they have this loci this crispr loci that basically stands for clustered repeats interspersed et cetera so basically it's it's an interspersed repeats structure where basically you have a set of repetitive regions and then interspersed were these variable segments that were basically matching viruses so when this was first discovered it was basically hypothesized that this is probably a bacterial immune system that remembers the trophies of the viruses that manage to kill and then the bacteria pass on you know they sort of do lateral transfer of dna and they pass on these memories so that the next bacterium says oh you killed that guy when that guy shows up again i will recognize him and the crispr system was basically evolved as a bacterial adaptive immune response to sense foreigners that should not belong and to just go and cut their genome so it's an rna guided rna cutting enzyme or an rna guided dna cutting enzyme so there's different systems some of them called dna some of them called rna but all of them remember this uh sort of viral attack so what we have done now as a field is you know through the work of you know uh jennifer donna emmanuel carpenter feng zhang and many others is co-opted that system of bacterial immune defense as a way to cut genomes you basically have this guiding system that allows you to use an rna guide to bring enzymes to cut dna at a particular locus that's so fascinating just so this is like already a natural mechanism a natural tool for cutting that was useful this particular context yeah and we're like well we can use that thing to actually it's a nice tool that's already in the body yeah yeah it's not in our body it's a bacterial body it was discovered by the by the yogurt industry they were trying to make better yogurts and they were trying to make their bacteria in their yogurt cultures more resilient to viruses and they were studying bacteria and they found that wow this crispr system is awesome it allows you to defend against that and then it was co-opted in mammalian systems that don't use anything like that as a as a as a targeting way to basically bring these dna cutting enzymes to any locus in the genome why would you want to cut dna to do anything the reason is that our dna has a dna repair mechanism where if a region of the genome gets randomly cut you will basically scan the genome for anything that matches and sort of use it by homology so the reason why we're deployed is because we now have a spare copy as soon as my mom's copy is deactivated i can use my dad's copy and somewhere else if my dad's copy is deactivated i can use my mom's copy to repair it so this is called homologous based repair so all you have to do is the the cutting and that's it you don't have to do the fixing that's exactly right you don't have to do the fixing because it's already built in that's exactly right but the fixing can be co-opted by throwing in a bunch of homologous segments that instead of having your dad's version have whatever other version you'd like to use so the thing so you you then control the fixing by throwing in a bunch of other stuff exactly right that's how you do genome editing so that's what crispr is that's what's wonderful in popular culture people use the term i've never well that's brilliant that's a crispr regional explanation genome vandalism followed by a bunch of band-aids that have the sequence that you'd like and you can control the the choices of band-aids correct yeah and of course there's new generations of crispr there's something that's called prime editing that was sort of very very much in the press recently that basically instead of sort of making a double stranded break which again is genome vandalism you basically make a single stranded break you basically just nick one of the two strands enabling you to sort of peel off without sort of completely breaking it up and then repair it locally using a guide that is coupled to your initial rna that took you to that location dumb question but is crispr as awesome and cool as it sounds i mean technically speaking in terms of like as a tool for manipulating our genetics in the positive uh meaning of the word manipulating or is there downsides drawbacks in this whole context of therapeutics that we're talking about yeah or understanding and so so so um when i teach my students about crispr i show them articles with the headline genome editing tool revolutionizes biology and then i show them the date of these two of these articles and they're 2004 like five years before crispr was invented and the reason is that they're not talking about crispr they're talking about zinc finger enzymes that are another way to bring these cutters to the genome it's a very difficult way of sort of designing the right set of zinc finger proteins the right set of amino acids that will now target a particular long stretch of dna because you you know for every location that you want to target you need to design a particular regulator a particular protein that will match that region well there's another technology called talens which are basically you know just a different way of using proteins to sort of you know guide these cutters to a particular location of the genome these require a massive team of engineers of biological engineers to basically design a set of amino acids that will target a particular sequence of your genome the reason why crispr is amazingly awesomely revolutionary is because instead of having this team of engineers design a new set of proteins for every locker that you want to target you just type it in your computer and you just synthesize an rna guide the beauty of crispr is not the cutting it's not the fixing all of that was there before it's the guiding and the only thing that changes that it makes the guiding easier by sort of you know just typing in the rna sequence which then allows the system to sort of scan the dna to find that so the coding the the engineering of the cutter is easier on the uh in terms of that's kind of similar to the story of deep learning versus uh old school machine learning some of the some of the challenging parts are automated okay so uh but crispr is just one cutting exact technology exactly and then there's that's part of the challenges and exciting opportunities of the field is to design different cutting technologies yeah yeah so now um we you know this was a big parenthesis on crispr but now you you know when we were talking about perturbations you basically now have the ability to not just look at correlation between enhancers and genes but actually go and either destroy that enhancer and see if the gene changes in expression or you can use the crispr targeting system to bring in not vandalism and cutting but you can couple the crispr system with and the crispr system is called usually crispr cas9 because cast 9 is the protein that will then come and cut but there's a version of that protein called dead cast 9 where the cutting part is deactivated so you basically use d cas9 dead cas9 to bring in an activator or to bring in a repressor so you can now ask is this enhancer changing that gene by taking this modified crispr which is already modified from the bacteria to be used in humans that you can now modify the cast 9 to be dead cas9 and you can now further modify it to bring in a regulator and you can basically turn on or turn off that enhancer and then see what is the impact on that gene so these are the four ways of linking the locus to the target gene and that's step number five okay step number five is find the target gene and step number six is what the heck does that gene do you basically now go and manipulate that gene to basically see what are the processes that change and you can basically ask well you know in this particular case in the fto locus we found mesenchymal stem cells that are the progenitors of white fat and brown fat or beige fat we found the rs-1421085 nucleotide variant as the causal variant we found this large enhancer this master regulator i like to call it ob1 for uh obesity one like the strongest enhancer associated with whatever and ob1 was kind of chubby as the actor i don't know if you remember him [Laughter] yeah so you basically are using this jedi mind trick to basically find out the uh thank you the location of the genome that is responsible the enhancer that harbors it the motif the upstream regulator which is arid 5b for 80 rich interacting domain 5b that's a protein that sort of comes and binds normally that protein is normally a repressor it represses this super enhancer this massive 12 000 nucleotide master regulatory control region and it turns off irx3 which is a gene that's 600 000 nucleotides away and irix 5 which is 1.2 million nucleotides away so those are what's the effect of turning them off that's exactly the next question so step six is what do these genes actually do so we then ask what does rx3 and rx5 do the first thing we did is look across individuals for individuals that had higher expression of rx3 or lower expression rx3 and then we looked at the expression of all of the other genes in the genome and we look for simply correlation and we found that iric 3 and rx-5 were both correlated positively with lipid metabolism and negatively with mitochondrial biogenesis you're like what the heck does that mean it doesn't sound related to obesity not at all superficially but lipid metabolism should because lipids is these high energy molecules that basically store fat so hyer extreme and rx5 are negatively correlated with lipid metabolism so that basically means that when they turn on lipid metabolism positively when they turn on they turn on lipid metabolism and they're negatively correlated with mitochondrial biotins what do mitochondria do in this whole process again small parenthesis what are mitochondria mitochondria are little organelles they arose they only are found in eukaryotes u means good karyo means nucleus so truly like a true nucleus so eukaryotes have a nucleus prokaryotes are before the nucleus they don't have a nucleus so eukaryotes have a nucleus compartmentalization eukaryotes have also organelles some eukaryotes have chloroplasts these are the plants they photosynthesize some other eukaryotes like us have another type of organelle called mitochondria these arose from an ancient species that we engulfed this is an endosymbiosis event symbiosis bio means life sim means together so symbiotes are things that live together endosymbiosis endomeans inside so endosymbiosis means you live together holding the other one inside you so the pre-eukaryotes engulfed an organism that was very good at energy production and that organism eventually shed most of its genome to now have only 13 genes in the mitochondrial genome and those 13 genes are all involved in energy production the electron transport chain so basically electrons are these massive super energy rich molecules we basically have these organelles that produce energy and when your muscle exercises you basically multiply your mitochondria you basically sort of you know use more and more mitochondria and that's how you get beefed up so basically the m the muscle sort of learns how to generate more energy so basically every single time your muscles will you know overnight regenerate and sort of become stronger and amplify their mitochondrions and so forth so what does mitochondria do the mitochondria use energy to sort of do any kind of task when you're thinking you're using energy this energy comes from mitochondria your neurons have mitochondria all over the place basically this mitochondria can multiply as organelles and they can be spread along the body of your muscle some of your muscle cells have actually multiple nuclei they're polynucleated but they also have multiple mitochondria to basically uh deal with the fact that your muscle is enormous you can sort of span this super super long length and you need energy throughout the length of your muscle so that's why you have mitochondria throughout the length and you also need transcription through the length so you have multiple nuclei as well so these two processes lipids store energy what do mitochondria do so there's a process known as thermogenesis thermoheat genesis generation thermogenesis is generation of heat remember that bathtub with in and out that's the equation that everybody's focused on so how much energy do you consume how much energy you burn but in every thermodynamic system there's three parts to the equation there's energy in energy out and energy lost any machine has loss of energy how do you lose energy you emanate heat so heat is energy loss so um there's which is where the thermogenesis comes in thermogenesis is actually a regulatory process that modulates the third component of the thermodynamic equation you can basically control thermogenesis explicitly you can turn on and turn off thermogenesis and that's where the mitochondria comes into exactly so irix 3 and rx5 turn out to be the master regulators of a process of thermogenesis versus lipogenesis generation of fat so irex and rx5 in most people burn heat burn burn calories as heat so when you eat too much just burn it burn it off in your in your fat cells so if that bathtub has basically a sort of dissipation knob that most people are able to turn on i am unable to turn that on because i am a homozygous carrier for the mutation that changes a t into a c in the rs1421085 allele a locus a snip i have the risk allele twice from my mom and for my dad so i'm unable to thermogenize i'm unable to turn on thermogenesis through irix 3 and rx5 because the regulator that normally binds here r85b can no longer buy because it's an 80 rich interacting domain and as soon as i change the t into a c it can no longer bind because it's no longer at rich but doesn't that mean that you're able to use the energy more efficiently you're not generating heat or is it that means that i can eat less and get around just fine yes yeah so that's a feature actually it's a feature in a food scarce environment yeah but if we're all starving i'm doing great if we all have access to massive amounts of food i'm i'm obese basically that's taken us through the entire process of then understanding that why mitochondria and then the lipids are both no distant or somehow different size of the same coin and you basically choose to store energy or you can choose to burn energy and then all of that is involved in the puzzle of obesity and that's what's fascinating right here we are in 2007 discovering the strongest genetic association with obesity and knowing nothing about how it works for almost 10 years for 10 years everybody focused on this fto gene and they were like oh it must have to do something with you know rna modification and it's like no it has nothing to do with the function of fto it has everything to do with all of this other process and suddenly the moment you solve that puzzle which is a multi-year effort by the way and tremendous effort by melina and many many others so this tremendous effort basically led us to recognize this circuitry you went from having some 89 common variants associated in that region of the dna sitting on top of this gene to knowing the whole circuitry when you know the circuitry you can now go crazy you can now start intervening at every level you can start intervening at the arid 5b level you can start intervening with crispr cas9 at the single snip level you can start intervening at iraq 3 and rx5 directly there you can start intervening at the thermogenesis level because you know the pathway you can start interviewing at the at the differentiation level where these the decision to make either white fat or beige fat the energy burning base fat is made developmentally in the first three days of differentiation of your adipocytes so as they're differentiating you basically can choose to make fat burning machines or fat storing machines and sort of that's how you populate your your fat you basically can now go in pharmaceutically and do all of that and in our paper we actually did all of that we went in and manipulated every single aspect at the nucleotide level we used crispr cast 9 genome editing to basically take primary adipocytes from risk and non-risk individuals and show that by editing that one nucleotide out of 3.2 billion nucleotides in the human genome you could then flip between an obese phenotype and a lean phenotype like a switch you can basically take a micelles that are non-thermogenizing and just flipping to thermogenizing cells by changing one nucleotide it's mind-boggling it's so inspiring that this puzzle could be solved in this way and it feels within reach to then be able to crack the problem with some of these diseases what are so 2007 you mentioned 2000 what are the technologies the tools that came along that made this possible like what what are you excited about maybe if we just look at the buffet of things that you've kind of mentioned is there is this what's involved what should we be excited about what are you excited about i love that question because there's so much ahead of us there's so so much um there's uh so so basically solving that one locus required massive amounts of knowledge that we have been building across the years through the epigenome through the comparative genomics to find out the causal variant and the control the controller regulatory motif through the conserved circuitry it required knowing this regulatory genomic wiring it required high c of these sort of topologically associated domains to basically find this long-range interaction it required eqtls of this sort of genetic perturbation of these intermediate gene phenotypes it required all of the arsenal of tools that i've been describing was put together for one locus and this was a massive team effort huge you know investment in time energy money effort intellectual you know everything you're referring to i'm sorry this one basically yeah this one piece this one single paper at least one single locus i like to say that this is a paper about one nucleotide in the human genome about one bit of information c versus t in the human genome that's one bit of information and we have 3.2 billion nucleotides to go through so how do you do that systematically i am so excited about the next phase of research because the technologies that my group and many other groups have developed allows us to now do this systematically not just one locus at a time but thousands of loci at a time so let me describe some of these technologies the first one is automation and robotics so basically you know we talked about how you can take all of these molecules and see which of these molecules are targeting each of these genes and what do they do so you can basically now screen through millions of molecules through thousands and thousands and thousands of plates each of which has thousands and thousands and thousands of molecules every single time testing um you know all of these genes and asking which of these molecules perturb these genes so that's technology number one automation and robotics technology number two is parallel readouts so instead of perturbing one locus and then asking if i use crispr cast 9 on this enhancer to basically use dcas9 to turn on or turn off the enhancer or if i use crystal cast 9 on the snip to basically change that one snip at a time then what happens but we have 120 000 disease associated snips that we want to test we want we don't want to spend 120 000 years doing it so what do we do we've basically developed this technology for massively parallel reporter assays mpra so in collaboration with tarzan mickelson mary flanders i mean jason dura's group has done a lot of that so there's there's a lot of groups that basically have developed technologies for testing 10 000 genetic variants at a time how do you do that you you know we talked about micro array technology the ability to synthesize these huge microarrays that allow you to do all kinds of things like measure gene expression by hybridization by measuring the genotype of a person by looking at hybridization with one version with a t versus the other version with the t with an with a c and then sort of figuring out that i am a risk carrier for obesity based on these hybridization differential hybridization in my genome that says oh you seem to only have this allele or you seem to have that allele microarrays can also be used to systematically synthesize small fragments of dna so you can basically synthesize these 150 nucleotide long fragments across 450 000 spots at a time you can now take the result of that synthesis which basically works through all of these sort of layers of adding one nucleotide at a time you can basically just type it into your computer and order it and you can basically order 10 000 or 100 000 of these small dna segments at a time and that's where awesome molecular biology comes in you can basically take all these segments have a common start and end barcode or sort of like gator like you just like pieces of a puzzle you can make the same end piece and the same start piece for all of them and you can now use plasmids which are these extra chromosomal small dna circular segments that are basically inhabiting all our all our genomes we basically have you know plasmids floating around i mean bacteria use plasmids for transferring dna and that's where they put a lot of antibiotic resistance genes so they can easily transfer them from one but one bacterium to the other so one bacterium involves a gene to be resistant to a particular antibiotic it basically says to all its friends hey here's that sort of dna piece we can now co-opt these plasmids into human cells you can basically make a human cell culture and add plasmids to that human cell culture that contain the things that you want to test you now have this library of 450 000 elements you can insert them each into the common plasmid yeah and then test them in millions of cells in parallel and the common plasmid is all the same before you add it exactly the rest of the plasmid is the same so it's it's called an episomal reporter assay episome means not inside the genome it's sort of outside the chromosomes so it's an episomal assay that allows you to have a variable region where you basically test 10 000 different enhancers and you have a common region which basically has the same reporter gene you know some can do some very cool molecular biology you can basically take the 450 000 elements that you've generated and and you have a piece of the puzzle here a piece of the puzzle here which is identical so they're compatible with that plasmid you can chop them up in the middle to separate a barcode reporter from the enhancer and in the middle put the same gene again using the same pieces of the puzzle you now can have a barcode readout of what is the impact of 10 000 different versions of an enhancer on gene expression so we're not doing one experiment we're doing 10 000 experiments and those ten thousand can be five thousand of different loci and each of them in two versions risk or non-risk i can now test tens of these little hypotheses exactly and then you can do ten thousand and we can test ten thousand hypothesis at once how how hard is it to generate those ten thousand uh trivial trivial but it's biology no no generating the ten thousand is trivial because you basically add it by technology you basically have these arrays that that add one nucleotide at a time at every spot oh and yeah so it's printing in it so you're able to you're able to control yeah uh super costly is it ten thousand bucks so this isn't millions thousand bucks for ten thousand experiments sounds like the right you know i mean so that's super that's exciting because you don't have to do one thing at a time yeah you can now use that technology these massively parallel reporter assays to test 10 000 locations at a time we've made multiple modifications of that technology one was sharper mpra which stands for you know basically getting a higher resolution view by tiling these um these elements so you can see where along the region of control are they acting and we made another modification called hydra for high you know definition regulatory annotation or something like that which basically allows you to test seven million of these at a time by sort of cutting them directly from the dna so instead of synthesizing which basically has the limit of 450 000 that you can synthesize at a time we basically said hey if we want to test all accessible regions of the genome let's just do an experiment that cuts accessible regions let's take those accessible regions put them all with the same end joints of the puzzles and then now use those to create a much much larger much much larger uh array of things that you can test and then tiling all of these regions you can then pinpoint what are the driver nucleotides what are the elements how are they acting across seven million experiments at a time so basically this is all the same family of technology where you're basically using these parallel readouts of the barcodes and then you know to do this we used a technology called starseek for self-transcribing uh reporter asses a technology developed by alex stark my my former postdoc who's now api over in vienna so we basically coupled the starsig the self-transcribing uh reporters where the enhancer can be part of the the gene itself so instead of having a separate barcode that enhancer basically acts to turn on the gene and it's transcribed as part of the gene so you don't have to have the two separate parts exactly so you can just read them so there's a constant improvements in this whole process yes by the way generating all these options are is it basically brute force uh how much human intuition is oh gosh of course it's human intuition and human creativity and incorporating all of the input data sets because again the the genome is enormous 3.2 billion you don't want to test that instead you basically use all of these tools that i've talked about already you generate your top favorite 10 000 hypothesis and then you go and test all ten thousand and then from what what comes out you can then go go to the next step so that's technology number two so technology one number one is robotics automation where you have thousands of wells and you constantly test them the second technology is instead of having wells you have these massively parallel readouts in sort of these pooled asses the third technology is coupling crispr perturbations with these single cell rna readouts so let me make another parenthesis here to describe now single cell rna sequencing okay so what does single cellular sequencing mean so rna sequencing is what has been traditionally used oh well traditionally the last 20 years ever since the advent of next generation sequencing so basically before rna expression profiling was based on this microarrays the next technology after that was based on sequencing so you chop up your rna and you just sequence small molecules just like you would sequence the genome basically reverse transcribe the small rnas into dna and you sequence that dna in order to get the number of sequencing reads corresponding to the expression level of every gene in the genome you now have rna sequencing how do you go to single cell rna sequencing that technology also went through stages of evolution the first was microfluidics you basically had these or even even chambers you basically had these ways of isolating individual cells putting them into a well for every one of these cells so you have 384 well plates and you know do 384 parallel reactions to measure the expression of 384 cells that sounds amazing and it was amazing but we want to do a million cells how do you go from you know these wells to a million cells you can't so what what what the next technology was after that is instead of using a well for every reaction you now use a lipid droplet for every reaction so you use micro droplets as reaction chambers to basically amplify rna so here's the idea you basically have microfluidics where you basically have every single cell coming down one tube in your microfluidics and you have little bubbles getting created in the other way with specific primers that mark every cell with its own barcode you basically couple the two and you end up with little bubbles that have a cell and tons of markers for that cell you now mark up all of the rna for that one cell with the same exact barcode and you then lice all of the droplets and you sequence the heck out of that and you have for every rna molecule a unique identifier that tells you what cell was it on that is such good engineering microfluidics and uh using some kind of primer to put it put up put a label on the thing i mean i don't you're making it sound easy i assume it's it's beautiful right challenging but it's gorgeous yeah so there's the next generation engineering yeah so that's the second generation next generation is forget the microfluidics all together just use big bottles how can you possibly do that with big bottles so here's the idea you dissociate all of your cells or all of your nuclei from complex cells like brain cells that you know are very long and sticky so you can't do that so you know if you have blood cells or if you have you know neuronal nuclei or brain nuclei you can basically dissociate let's say a million cells you now want to add a unique barcode a unique barcode in each one of a million cells using only big bottles i can't possibly do that sounds crazy but here's the idea you use a hundred of these bottles you randomly shuffle all your million cells and you throw them into the hundred bottles randomly completely random you add one barcode out of 100 to every one of those cells you then you now take them all out you shuffle them again and you throw them again into the same hundred bottles but now in a different randomization and you add a second barcode so every cell now has two barcodes you take them out again you shuffle them and you throw them back in another third barcode is adding randomly from the same hundred barcodes you've now labeled every cell probabilistically based on the unique path that he took of which of a hundred bottles to go for the first time which of 100 bottles a second time and which of 100 bottles a third time a hundred times 100 times 100 is a million unique barcodes in every single one of these cells without ever using microfluidic very clever that's beautiful right computer science perspective that's very clever so you now have the single cell sequencing technology you can use the wells you can use the bubbles or you can use the bottles and you know sort of you have way bubbles still sound pretty damp because bubbles are awesome and that's basically the main technology that we're using okay so the evolves is the main technology so so there are kids now that companies to sell to basically carry out single cell or any sequencing that you know you can basically for two thousand dollars you can basically get ten thousand cells from one sample and for every one of those cells you basically have the transcription of thousands of genes and you know of course the data for any one cell is noisy but being computer scientists we can aggregate the data from all of those cells together across thousands of individuals together to basically make very robust inferences okay so the third technology is basically single cell rna sequencing that allows you to now start asking not just what is the brain expression level difference of that genetic variant but what is the expression difference of that one genetic variant across every single subtype of brain cell how is the variance changing you can't just you know with a brain sample you can just ask about the mean what is the average expression if i instead have 3 000 cells that are neurons i can ask not just what is the neuronal expression i can say for layer 5 excitatory neurons of which i have i don't know 300 cells what is the variance that this genetic variant has so suddenly it's amazingly more powerful i can basically start asking about this middle layer of gene expression at unprecedented levels and when you look at the average it washes out some potentially important signal that corresponds to ultimately the disease completely yeah so that i can do that at the rna level but i can also do that at the dna level for the epigenome so remember how before i was telling you about all these technologies we're using to probe the epigenome one of them is dna accessibility so what we're doing in my lab is that from the same dissociation of say a brain sample where you now have all these tens of thousands of cells floating around you basically take half of them to do rna profiling and the other have to do epigenome profiling both at the single cell level so that allows you to now figure out what are the millions of dna enhancers that are accessible in every one of tens of thousands of cells and computationally we can now take the rna and the dna readout and group them together to basically figure out how is every enhancer related to every gene and remember these sort of enhancer gene linking that we were doing across 833 samples 833 is awesome don't get me wrong but 10 million is way more awesome so we can now look at correlated activity across 2.3 million enhancers and 20 000 genes in each of millions of cells to basically start piecing together the regulatory circuitry of every single type of neuron every single type of astrocytes oligodendrocyte microglial cell inside the brains of 1500 individuals that we've sampled across multiple different brain regions across both dna and rna so that's the data set that my team generated last year alone so in one year we basically generated 10 million cells from human brain across a dozen different disorders across schizophrenia alzheimer's frontal temporal dementia louis body dementia als you know huntington's disease post-traumatic stress disorder autism like you know bipolar disorder healthy aging etc so it's possible that even just within that data set lie a lot of keys to understanding these diseases and then be able to like directly leads to then treatment correct correct so basically we are now motivating yeah so our computational team is in heaven right now and we're looking for people i mean if you have super how much does this decision so this is a very interesting kind of side question how much of this is biology how much of this is computation so you have the computational biology group but how much of are you should should you be comfortable with biology to be able to solve some of these problems if you just find if you put several of the hats you were on fundamentally are you thinking like a computer scientist here you have to this is the only way as i said we are the descendants of the first digital computer we're trying to understand the digital computer we understand we're trying to understand the circuitry the logic of this digital you know core computer and all of these analog layers surrounding it so you you know the case that i've been making is that you cannot think one gene at a time the traditional biology is dead there's no way you cannot solve disease with traditional biology you need it as a component once you've figured out rx3 and rx5 you now can then say hey have you guys worked on those genes with your single gene approach we'd love to know everything you know and if you haven't we now know how important these genes are let's now launch a single gene program to dissect them and understand them but you cannot use that as a way to dissect disease you have to think genomically you have to think from the global perspective and you have to build these circuits systematically so we need numbers of computer scientists who are interested and willing to dive into this data you know fully fully in and sort of extract meaning we need computer science people who can understand sort of machine learning and inference and sort of you know decouple these matrices come up with super smart ways of sort of dissecting them but we also need by all computer scientists who understand biology who are able to design the next generation of experiments because many of these experiments no one in the right mind would design them without thinking of the analytical approach that you would use to deconvolve the data afterwards right because it's massive amounts of ridiculously noisy data and if you don't have the computational pipeline in your head before you even design the experiment you would never design the experiment that way that's brilliant so you in designing the experiment you have to see the entirety of the computational pipeline that drives the design that that even drives the necessity for that design basically you know if you didn't have a computer scientist way of thinking you would never design these hugely combinatorial massively parallel experiments so that's why you need interdisciplinary teams you need teams and and i want to i want to sort of clarify that what do we mean by computational biology group the focus is not on computational the focus is on the biology so we are a biology group what type of biology computational biology yeah the type of biology that uses the whole genome that's the type of biology that designs experiments genomic experiments that can only be interpreted in the context of the whole genome right so it's it's philosophically looking at biology as a computer correct correct so which is a in the context of the history of biology is a big transformation yeah yeah you can think of the name as what do we do only computation that's not true but how do we study it only computationally that is true so all of these single cell sequencing can now be coupled with the technologies that we talked about earlier for perturbation so here's a crazy thing instead of using these wells and these robotic systems for doing one drug at a time or for perturbing one gene at a time in thousands of wells you can now do this using a pool of cells and single cell or any sequencing how you basically can take these perturbations using crispr and instead of using a single guide rna you can use a library of guide rnas generated exactly the same way using this array technology so you synthesize a thousand different guide rnas you now take each of these guide rnas and you insert them in a pool of cells where every cell gets one perturbation and you use crispr editing or crispr uh so with either crispr cas9 to edit the gina with these thousand perturbations or the or with the activation or with the repression and you now can have a single cell readout where every single cell has received one of these modifications and you can now in massively parallel ways couple the perturbation and the readout in a single experiment how are you tracking which perturbations each cell received so there's there's ways of doing that but basically one way is to make that perturbation an expressible vector so that part of your rna reading is actually that perturbation itself so you can basically put it in a expressible part so you can self-drive it so the the point that i want to get across is that the sky is the limit you basically have these tools these building blocks of molecular biology you have this massive data sets of computational biology you have this huge ability to sort of use machine learning and statistical methods and you know linear algebra to sort of reduce the dimensionality of all these massive data sets and then you end up with a series of actionable targets that you can then couple with pharma and just go after systematically so the ability to sort of bring genetics to the epigenomics to the transcriptomics to the cellular readouts using these sort of high throughput perturbation technology that i'm talking about and ultimately to the organismal through the electronic health record endophenotypes and ultimately the disease battery of assays at the cognitive level at the physiological level and you know every other level this there is no better or more exciting field in my view to be a computer scientist then or to be a scientist in period basically this confluence of technologies of computation of data of insight and of tools for manipulation is unprecedented in human history and i think this is what's shaping the next century to really be a transformative century for our species and for our planet so you think the 21st century will be remembered for the big leaps in biology and understanding and alleviation of biology if you look at the path between discovery and therapeutics it's been on the order of 50 years it's been shortened to 40 30 20 and now it's on the order of 10 years but the huge number of technologies that are going on right now for discovery will result undoubtedly in the most dramatic manipulation of human biology that we've ever seen in the history of humanity in the next few years do you think we might be able to cure some of the diseases we started this conversation with absolutely absolutely it's it's only a matter of time basically the complexity is enormous and i don't want to underestimate the complexity but the number of insides is unprecedented and the ability to manipulate is unprecedented and the ability to deliver these small molecules and other non-traditional medicine perturbations there's a lot of sort of new gen there's a new generation of perturbations that you can use at the dna level at the rna level at the you know microrna level uh the genomic level there's there's a battery of new generations of perturbations if you couple that with cell type identifiers that can basically sense when you are in the right cell based on the specific combination and then turn on that intervention for that cell you can now think of combinatorial interventions where you can basically sort of feed a synthetic biology construct to someone that will basically do different things in different cells so basically for cancer this is one of the therapeutics that our collaborator ron weiss is using to basically start sort of engineering these circuits that will use microrna sensors of the environment to sort of know if you're in a tumor cell or if you're in an immune cell or if you're in stromal cells and so forth and basically turn on particular interventions there you can sort of create constructs that are tuned to only the liver cells or only the heart cells or only the you know uh you know brain cells and then have these new generations of therapeutics coupled with this immense amount of knowledge on the sort of which targets to choose and what biological processes to measure and how to intervene my view is that disease is going to be fundamentally altered and alleviated as we go forward next time we talk we'll talk about the philosophical implications that the effect of life but let's stick to biology for just a little longer we did pretty good today we still stuck to the science what um what are you excited in terms of uh the future of this of this field the technologies in your own group in your own mind you're leading the world at mit in the science and the engineering of this work so what are you excited about here i could not be more excited we are one of many many teams who are working on this in my team the most exciting parts are um you know manifold so basically we've now assembled this battery of technologies we've assembled these massive massive data sets and now we're really sort of in the stage of uh our our team's path of generating disease insights so we are simultaneously working on a paper on schizophrenia right now that is basically using the single cell profiling technologies using this editing and manipulation technologies to basically show how the master regulators underlying changes in the brain that are sort of found in in schizophrenia are in fact affecting excitatory neurons and inhibitory neurons in pathways that are active both in synaptic pruning but also in early development we've basically found a set of four regulators that are connecting these two processes that were previously separate in schizophrenia in sort of having a sort of more unified view across those two those two sides the second one is in the in the area of metabolism we basically now have a beautiful collaboration with the goodyear lab that's basically looking at um multi-tissue perturbations in six or seven different tissues across the body in the context of exercise and in the context of nutritional interventions using both mouse and human where we can basically see what are the cell to cell communications that are that are changing across them and what we're finding is this immense role of both immune cells as well as adipocyte stem cells in sort of reshaping that circuitry of all of these different tissues and that sort of painting to a new path for therapeutical interventions there in alzheimer's it's this huge focus on microglia and now we're discovering different classes of microglial cells that are basically either synaptic or um immune and these are playing vastly different roles in alzheimer's versus in schizophrenia and what we're finding is this immense complexity as you go further and further down of how in fact there's 10 different types of microglia each with their own sort of expression programs we used to think of them as oh yeah they're microglia but in fact now we're realizing just even in that sort of least abundant of cell types there's this incredible diversity there the differences between brain regions is is another sort of major major insight again you know one would think that oh astrocytes are astrocytes no matter where they are but no there's incredible region-specific differences in the expression patterns of all of the major brain cell types across different brain regions so basically there's the neocortical regions that are sort of the recent innovation that makes us so different from all other species there's the sort of you know reptilian brain sort of regions that are sort of much more uh you know very extremely distinct there's a cerebellum there's um each of those basically is associated in a different way with disease and what we're doing now is looking into pseudotemporal models for how disease progresses across different regions of the brain if you look at alzheimer's it basically starts in this small region called the enter rhino cortex and then it spreads through the brain and uh you know through the hippocampus and you know the uh ultimately affecting the neocortex and with every brain region that it hits it basically has a different impact on the cognitive and you know memory aspects orientation short-term memory long-term memory etc which is you know dramatically affecting the cognitive path that the individuals go through so what we're doing now is creating these computational models for ordering the cells and the regions and the individuals according to their ability to predict alzheimer's disease so we can have a cell level predictor of pathology that allows us to now create a temporal time course that tells us when every gene turns on along this pathology progression and then trace that across regions and pathological measures that are region-specific but also cognitive measures and so so forth so that allows us to now sort of for the first time look at can we actually do early intervention for alzheimer's where we know that the disease starts manifesting for 10 years before you actually have your first cognitive loss can we start seeing that path to build new diagnostics new prognosis new biomarkers for this sort of early intervention in alzheimer's the other aspect that we're looking at is mosaicism we talked about the common variants and the rare variants but in addition to those rare variants as your initial cell uh that that forms the zygote divides and divides and divides with every cell division there are additional mutations that are happening so what you end up with is your brain being a mosaic of multiple different types of genetic underpinnings some cells contain imitation that other cells don't have so every human has the common variant that all of us carry to some degree the rare variant that your immediate tree of the human species carries and then there's the somatic variant which is the tree that happened after the zygote that sort of forms your own body so these somatic alterations is something that has been previously inaccessible to study in human postmortem samples but right now with the advent of single cell rna sequencing in this particular case we're using the well-based sequencing which is much more expensive but gives you a lot richer information about each of those transcripts so we're using now that richer information to infer mutations that have happened in each of the thousands of genes that sort of are active in these cells and then understand how the genome relates to the function this genotype phenotype relationship that we usually build in geos between genomic association studies between genetic variation and disease we're now building that at the cell level where for every cell we can relate the unique specific genome of that cell with the expression patterns of that cell and the predicted function using these predictive models that i mentioned before on this regulation for cognition for pathology in alzheimer's at the cell level and what we're finding is that the genes that are altered and the genetic regions that are altered in common variants versus rare variant versus somatic variant are actually very different from each other the somatic variants are pointing to neuronal energetics and oligodendrocyte functions that are not visible in the genetic lesions that you find for the common variants probably because they have too strong of an effect that evolution is just not tolerating them on the common side of the allele frequency spectrum so the somatic one that's the variation that happens after the the zygo after correct you individual i mean it's a dumb question but there's there's mutation and variation i guess that happens there and you're saying that they're through this if we focus in on individual cells we're able to detect a story that's interesting there and that might be a very unique kind of important variability that arises for you said neuronal or something energetic energetics energetic cool terms so your your i mean the metabolism of humans is dramatically altered from that of nearby species you know we talked about that last time that basically we are able to consume meat that is incredibly energy rich and that allows us to sort of have functions that are you know meeting this humongous brain that we have it's basically on one hand every one of our brain cells is much more energy efficient than our neighbors than our relatives number two we have way more of these cells and number three we have you know this new diet that allows us to now feed all these needs that basically creates a massive amount of damage oxidative damage from this huge super powered factory of ideas and thoughts that we that we carry in our skull and that factory has energetic needs and there's a lot of sort of biological processes underlying that that we are finding are altered in the context of alzheimer's disease that's fascinating that so you have to consider all of these systems if you want to understand even something like diseases that you would maybe traditionally associate with just the particular cells of the brain yeah the immune system the metabolic system the metabolic system and these are all the things that makes us uniquely human so our immune system is dramatically different from that of our neighbors our societies are so much more clustered the history of infections that have plagued the human population is you know dramatically different from every other species the the you know the way that our society in our population has sort of exploded has basically put unique pressures on our immune system and our immune system has both coped with that density and also been shaped by as i mentioned the you know vast amount of death that has happened in the black plague and other sort of selective events in human history famines ice ages and so forth so that's number one then on on the sort of immune side on the metabolic side you know again we are able to sort of run marathons you know you know i don't know if you remember the sort of human versus horse experiment where the horse actually tires out faster than the human and the human actually wins so so on the metabolic side we're dramatically different on the immune side we're dramatically different on the brain side again you know no need to sort of you know it's a no-brainer how our brain is like just enormously more capable and then uh in you know in the side of cancer so basically the cancers that humans are having the exposure the environmental exposures is again dramatically different and the lifespan the expansion of human lifespan is unseen in any other species in you know recent evolutionary history and that now leads to a lot of new disorders that are starting to you know manifest late in life so uh you know alzheimer's is one example where basically you know these vast energetic needs over a lifetime of thinking can basically lead to all of these debris and eventually saturate the system and lead to you know alzheimer's in in the late life but there's you know there's just such a such a dramatic uh set of frontiers when it comes to aging research that you know will so what i often like to say is that if you want to re to to engineer a car to go from 70 miles an hour to 120 miles an hour that's fine you can basically you know fix a few components if you wanted to now go out 400 miles an hour you have to completely redesign the entire car because the system has just not evolved to go that far basically our human body has only evolved to live to i don't know maybe we can get to 150 with minor changes but if you know as we start pushing these frontiers for not just living but well living the f zine that we talked about last time so to to basically push f zine into the 80s and 90s and 100s and you know much further than that we will face new challenges that have you know never been faced before in terms of cancer the number of divisions in terms of alzheimer's and brain related disorders in terms of metabolic disorders in terms of regeneration there's just so many different frontiers ahead of us so i am thrilled about where we're heading so basically i see this confluence in my lab and many other labs of ai of you know sort of you know the next frontier of ai for drug design so basically these sort of graph neural networks on specific chemical uh designs that allow you to create new generations of therapeutics these molecular biology tricks for intervening at the system at every level this personalized medicine prediction diagnosis and prognosis using the electronic health records and using these polygenic risk scores weighted by the burden the number of mutations that are accumulating across common rare and somatic variants the burden converging across all of these different molecular pathways the delivery of specific drugs and specific interventions into specific cell types and again you've talked with bob langer about this there's you know many giants in that field and then the last concept is not intervening at the single gene level i want you to sort of conceptualize the concept of an on target side effect what is an on target side effect an off-target side effect is when you design a molecule to target one gene and instead it targets another gene and you have side effects because of that an on target side effect is when your molecule does exactly what you're expecting but that gene is pliotropic plio means many tropos means ways many ways it acts in many ways it's a multifunctional gene so you find that this gene plays a role in this but as we talked about the wiring of genes to phenotypes is extremely dense and extremely complex so the next stage of intervention will be intervening not at the gene level but at the network level intervening at the set of pathways and the set of genes with multi-input perturbations to the system multi-input modulations pharmaceutical or other interventional that basically allow you to now work at the sort of full level of understanding not just in your brain but across your body not just in one gene but across the set of pathways and so forth for every one of these disorders so i think that we're finally at the level of systems medicine of basically instead of sort of medicine being at the single gene level medicine being at the systems level where it can be personalized based on a specific set of genetic markers and genetic perturbations that you are either born with or that you have developed during your lifetime your unique set of exposures your unique set of biomarkers and you know your unique set of you know current set of conditions through your ehr and other ways and the precision component of intervening extremely precisely in the specific pathways and specific combinations of genes that should be modulated to sort of bring you from the disease state to the physiologically normal state or even to a physiologically improved state through this combination of intervention so that that's in my view the field where basically computer science comes together with you know artificial intelligence statistics all of these other tools molecular biology technologies and biotechnology and pharmaceutical technologies that are sort of in revolutionary the way of intervention and of course this massive amount of molecular biology and data gathering and generation perturbation in massively parallel ways so there's no better way there's no better you know time there's no better place to be sort of you know looking at this whole confluence of of ideas and i'm just so thrilled to be a small part of this amazing enormous ecosystem it's exciting to imagine what the humans of 100 200 years from now what their life experience is like because these ideas seem to have potential to transform the quality of life that when they look back at us they probably wonder how we were put up with all the suffering in the world manoa it's a huge honor thank you for

but carriers passageways for genes they ride us into the ground like race horses from generation to generation genes don't think about what constitutes good or evil they don't care whether we're happy
