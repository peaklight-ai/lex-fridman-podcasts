if Scientology was just getting auditing when you wanted about the subjects you wanted and you could take it or leave it that would be fine it's it's the fact that it's part and parcel to this entire organization and this entire experience that has as a part of that experience taking everything from you demanding everything from you controlling who you can speak with controlling who you can have relationships with who you have to erase from your life this is where and it's hard to it's hard to place one pinpoint on this is where Scientology goes wrong it's really hard to do that because the good parts of Scientology and the bad parts of Scientology are all just Scientology the following is a conversation with Aaron Smith 11 a former Scientologist raised in Scientology and have worked in an organization full-time for many years as a staff member and a sea org member including the job of training Scientology Auditors today he educates the public about scientology on his YouTube channel called growing up in Scientology this is Alex Friedman podcast to support it please check out our sponsors in the description and now dear friends here's Aaron Smith Levin let's do a full overview of Scientology its ideas how it operates how it wields its power and influence and let's start at the very Basics what is Scientology Scientology is a belief system created by allren Hubbard that does fundamentally believe that we are all Immortal Spiritual Beings called phasins that we have native god-like potential that there is nothing more powerful in the universe than a thetan like so Godlike is you know quite literal here and that through various decisions thetans have made they have fallen away from their native Godlike power to uh fallen down to a state where most theins aren't even aware that they are thetans aren't even aware that they ever have lived before or have these powers and that things are now in a state where they're trapped in bodies trapped here on Earth uh trapped in this prison of a physical Universe trapped on this prison of a planet and that only Scientology can restore ethane to its native state are these multiple beings like is there one Satan inside of me that's trapped in this prison well the thing would be you the thing would be me the thetan is you but um presumably Limited in some fundamental way so this statement that is me is is limited so there's like eight billion Satan's on the planet there's one primary thing in animating each body later in Scientology you learn there's actually like tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of like sick unconscious half dead faith in stuck to you that are now an additional cause of problems for you sure but fundamentally at the lower levels the non-confidential levels there's just one thing in per body well I mean it's an interesting idea I just would like to kind of explore the philosophy of that so there's a being that's all powerful that's immortal and its projectionist manifestation on this Earth is fundamentally Limited and you're trying to uh the process of Scientology is the process of letting go of those limitations you know that's an interesting idea I mean a lot of religions have this kind of idea that there's a not just religions but like we have the capacity as human beings to do to achieve greatness in all kinds of ways yeah and that's the question we have with our cognitive abilities we start with the embryo and build up and into this organism and like this world of opportunities before us what are we capable of and the idea that we're capable of almost anything is a really powerful one and there's a lot of religions there's a lot of philosophies there's a lot of advice self-help that kind of explores those ideas and so in it seems like with Scientology this the application of these religious philosophy means that there's we're limited and we have to break through those limitations and there's a process to break through those limitations that would be correct so what can make it challenging to adequately and completely describe Scientology in the beginning is what scientologists believe actually changes as they progress further into or further up in Scientology so um the explanation is I've given it is pretty consistent with what you would get at the lowest levels right urethane I'm a thetan everyone's a thetan and we have a reactive mind I'll run Hubbard would say the reactive mind is a collection of uh these recordings mental recordings of any moments of pain and unconsciousness you've ever had in your life it's like the subconscious mind uh it's always recording in moments of pain and unconsciousness and that these are called these recordings are Ron Hubbard called them engrams now when L Ron Hubbard first wrote Dianetics in 1950 this was before Scientology came along a couple years later right so in 1950 when he wrote Dianetics it wasn't a spiritual Endeavor it was supposed to be a mental health a science of Mental Health so as of that time the earliest engram you could have was the incident of birth being born was an engram and technically in Dianetics they said you could have prenatal n grams like when you're still in the womb but there was no concept of past lives as of 1950 version of Dianetics right and so the idea there was that uh the reactive mind is essentially a stimulus response mechanism uh created through Evolution millions of years ago to protect the individual from things that would harm them in other words things that would bring about pain and unconsciousness so you have these recordings of things that hurt you created pain and unconsciousness and in present time these things will react upon you in a way to cause you to avoid similar things reacting upon you in a subconscious unconscious way so the reactive mind protects you from the trauma that is inside your subconscious mind yes and the idea is we've now as human beings evolve to a state where it no longer serves us beneficially it only serves us negatively this was Hubbard's Theory and he says you can get rid of these engrams by you know basically recalling them and going over them again and again using Dianetics auditing therapy and if you get back to the moment of birth and erase the earliest engram all the other subsequent engrams on the Chain would vanish oh nice so there's a change earlier similar earlier similar earlier similar early similar okay so that gives you a pretty good understanding of how elrond Hubbard thought of the mind because that carries on has applicability later on in Scientology I mean that's a pretty powerful model of the mind I mean Freud had similar conceptions that a lot of our traumas are grounded in sort of uh poor formulation of sexuality or imperfect formulation of sexuality no childhood something like this and then we're trying to figure out the puzzle whatever we formed in early childhood right and it's similar similar kind of it is similar that's probably what Hubbard took it from um in the early days of Dianetics before he decided Psychiatry was evil uh he actually credited Sigmund Freud with some of the shoulders he was standing on in writing Dianetics so the so he still admired Psychiatry at that time so that's an interesting moment of Dianetics so what else you mentioned Dynex auditing was there too so if we just before Scientology what what are the ideas that formed what we know as Dianetics as I've just described that is the fundamental at least that is pretty much the nuts and bolts of dinetics was it applied was it applied often oh yeah no that's what diet next in the early days was all about was just auditing auditing is the process of the one-on-one counseling recall a moment of pain and unconsciousness run through the engram over and over and over again find something earlier similar that is dianetics auditing one of the main things that changed with Scientology is that birth or prenatal ingrams were no longer the earliest engrams on the Chain yeah the idea is you have to get the earliest engram on the chain for the later ones to blow which is a race and so but all of a sudden now with the uh addition of an immortal spiritual being into the equation well now the earliest incident could be trillions of years ago in other galaxies and universes other universes so before the origin of this universe yes is there a model of physics integrated in any of this no the model is you have the physical universe and then above that you have the Theta universe so we use the word thing earlier so in Scientology let's use word Theta I don't know theta's just basically thetan power Satan's collectively so Hubbard would say you have the Theta Universe which is senior to the physical universe and creates the physical universe and remember I said I said native god-like potentials so we're not talking about the God who created the Earth we're just like scientologists don't believe in a God but we'll get into that later uh we're talking about CR just creating universes like just think like Matrix like just when I say creating a universe essentially just creating different things simulations but it sounds like a little bit more like the ideas of Plato which is there's these platonic forms there's abstract forms that are bigger more General than our particular reality here and those forms are used to construct the reality well I grew up in a call so I'm not familiar with the works of Plato [Laughter] you can't use that as an excuse for everything I would like to you know non-jokingly yeah Steel Man the case because a lot of philosophies a lot of religions a lot even scientific endeavors are a little bit full of uncertainty you can call it bullshit but they're you're on on sturdy ground because we're surrounded by mystery and you have to take these ideas somewhat seriously and see where those ideas go wrong this happens with Communism this happens with capitalism these ideas sound beautiful in their ideal forms and then they somehow go wrong and some go more wrong than others and so I don't think sort of it's easy to sort of caricature and make fun of the ideas I think if we take them seriously you'll start to understand like when you're in it it was serious uh it can be very convincing it's you know the the devil is going to be a charismatic person he's not going to be a caricature of ridiculous person so that that helps us understand which ideas uh will sound appealing but will become dangerous I totally agree in fact it's one of the thrusts uh I have on my channel is wanting to talk about scientology in a way that would actually resonate with current scientologists not just resonate with former scientologists I want people who are still in to be able to hear how I talk about it and go wow he's being really fair and really accurate he's not just a hater you know what I mean if you look at the you know let's take one of the worst places on Earth is North Korea uh you have Kim Jong-un and the reality is there's a lot of citizens of that nation that deeply love the leader because they've grew up in that way and you I mean through fear through all kinds of manipulation through propaganda and so on they're not allowed to love members of their own family they're not allowed to have romantic love they're only allowed to have love for the leader and to reach those people you have to empathize with the fact that in their eyes in some sense this is a great man this is a god a Messianic figure you can't just make fun of the Ridiculousness of the situation that this pudgy person Waltzing around creating propaganda like how is this a funny haircut with a funny haircut like it's so easy and Hitler too to make fun of to make a caricature of the person but this is a real person a real person that influenced the minds of millions of people in the case of Hitler uh you know tens of millions of people and and created a huge amount of suffering not because of um the caricature version but because he was a charismatic leader he was somebody that people deeply deeply loved and that just over time I mean with the the abuse of any kind of ideology this this happens over and over and so yeah it's it's interesting because Scientology is so close to the uh to to the core of what is America because so many Americans are involved with it so it's interesting to study the the Beauty and the power of the idea is that underlie it and where things go wrong yeah and I'll just say it's interesting to know you would never get a representative of the Church of Scientology to sit down and have a conversation with you and even be as fair and accurate about scientology as I'm going to be which is which is noteworthy do you honestly deeply believe that's the case there's not going to be a high level official that would sit down for a conversation no I disagree with you I hope you're right because I think that given the current dynamics of what's Happening I think in order to say from their perspective in order to save the the Church of Scientology they have to uh be transparent and authentic basically steal men their case but better you would think so well we'll talk about the other ways you could do that which is the manipulation to propaganda through control media and all that kind of stuff they paint themselves into a corner of not being able to send a representative out into the world to speak honestly about it because you're literally not allowed to so when faced you know if you're just sitting down with an entertainment journalist a representative might be able to fudge their way through an interview but sitting down for a long Format Interview with someone who is going to ask them about Xenu and the body fatens and Leah Remini and Lisa McPherson that's a no-go zone so so I'm representing why it will never happen but shit I would I would tune in for that interview I mean I hope you do get someone you don't think David miscavage was the dolphin interview I would love to be wrong you know in general journalists in these kinds of situations can be um can attack in a way that doesn't empathize and doesn't come from a place of deep knowledge and understanding and I think it's possible to have serious conversations with people like that in an empathetic way but it's also in a challenging way I think there's a huge amount of trust required and obviously for us a very secretive organization the amount of trust yes might be too much required anyone over there if they've done their homework knows you're going to be as Fair as anyone in the world is going to be and yet they're simply things they're not allowed to talk about and they're not even allowed to say I'm not allowed to talk about it so that's a fundamental part of the Church of Scientology is the secrecy yeah so that's what you're trained as you go up through the ranks as secrecy Secrets it's not even a matter of training it's that there's an entire the entire upper half of scientology's bridge is simply confidential I mean and I never even did those levels when I was in Scientology I didn't learn what scientologists actually believe on those upper levels until after I get out of Scientology and I was freaking born and raised in it let's go there let's go to a personal story so you've spent 30 years in Scientology yeah I was four years old when my mom got in and then about seven years ago I got out yeah and you're on what YouTube channel now and you're an educator so I was four years old when my mom got introduced to Scientology and she got in really fast really quick um so but I was 12 years old when I was taken out of school and started officially full-time working for Scientology okay so um in various capacities I worked for them from the ages of 12 to the age of 26. yeah okay so and then I was 34 when I officially parted ways with Scientology which was really more them officially parting ways with me but we can get into all that later that's just kind of how Scientology does it and what do you do now in terms of Scientology so now I run growing up in Scientology the YouTube channel but what I primarily do is I help run an organization that helps people who are escaping from Scientology I'm the vice president of the aftermath Foundation and we created the foundation after the television show Leah Remini Scientology in the aftermath and there was such an outpouring of support from non-scientologists all over the world what can we do to help people leave Scientology that we decided to create a foundation and it's been incredibly successful we've helped people escape from all regions and echelons of Scientology we we've accomplished what we've accomplished is far beyond what we actually envisioned would be possible it's been a huge success so we'll talk about the the negative aspect the abuses of power but let's just explore the ideas a little bit more um so the the public facing three fundamental truths of Scientology maybe correct me if I'm wrong a man is an immortal spiritual being like with said with Satan's his experience extends well beyond a single lifetime so infinite memory backwards his capabilities are unlimited even if not presently realized the capabilities are unlimited yeah so that when I say god-like I really just mean you know Thanos like Unlimited scientologists don't believe in a God so when I say God like I just mean the most powerful entity the Creator the the prime mover unmoved except we are all that you know a thing in definition in Scientology thing has no position in space or time ethane does not actually exist in the physical Universe it might choose to locate itself in the physical Universe right and then forget that it made that decision and then sort of get caught and trapped in the physical universe but that once the thing is uh restored to its native powers um everything you see here in the physical universe is just a thing playing a game like later we are in a simulation right now of something so like physics doesn't have to make sense when we're talking about it this way like technically urethane imatha and we're here but because this could also all just be another thing's game so Satan's all the way down yeah it's just Dayton's everywhere things it all comes down to the thing is there an idea of a God because I've read there's a kind of there is a sense of a Supreme Being because that basically the thetan that's at the core at the bottom of it all yes not not defined undefined correct Scientology has this concept of the Dynamics all right Hubbard breaks life into eight different Dynamics and the a dynamic meaning a Thrust towards survival so he would say you know first Dynamic is you yourself second Dynamic is your family third Dynamic is any other group that you're a part of other than your family fourth Dynamic is all humankind uh the fifth Dynamic is plant and animal life all non-human life uh sixth Dynamic is the physical world seventh Dynamic is sort of like spirituality collectively and the eighth Dynamic L Ron Hubbard says Scientology doesn't deal with the eighth Dynamic but we recognize that people have this idea of a Supreme Being and so Scientology says you can call the eighth Dynamic the Supreme Being Dynamic but we call it Infinity just the allness of everything without having to Define it and then they sort of do a little dance and they're like Scientology the purpose of Scientology is to get you to the point where you have your own understandings or realizations about the nature of the eighth Dynamic we don't tell you what you have to believe about that and technically speaking that is true technically speaking that is true there's no point in Scientology where they sit you down and say you're now required to revoke your belief in a Supreme Being it's just that everything in Scientology is is inconsistent with a belief in the Supreme Being you can still find scientologists who through cognitive dissonance will tell you they believe in a supreme being mostly they're lying to you how's this inconsistent with the Supreme Being because like Satan's because Satan's have created everything not God okay so things creative they they're also creative for us they're not just the force that runs everything right but can't those be just the fingertips of a god sure the only way you could reconcile a Supreme Being is if you say a single Supreme Being created all Theta yeah like the spiritual Big Bang yep but that's not what most people think when they say when they talk about God they're talking about a creator of the physical Universe yes there's no Theta right I mean even as I've described Scientology so far none of what I've said is something I even subject to riddle cool this is pretty Common Sense stuff actually I mean if you believe in spirituality or Spirits at all there's nothing I've described so far that's crazy yeah you know believing in past lives isn't particularly unique or special right um the fact that Scientology does this little dance of pretending to believe in a God I mean it's even like a PR line Scientology Representatives will tell you you can be a Christian and be a Scientologist well let me tell you what Christians don't believe in past lives and lives on other galaxies and planets and universes they but and Scientology knows that Scientology knows you can't be a Christian and be a Scientologist but they will say that it's just an example of sort of the fundamental baked in dishonesty because it's so important to Scientology on their organizational level to have text exempt status I wonder how do you do you know the process of what it takes to prove that some an organization is a religion while going through that process with the IRS for the second time by the way Scientology actually had tax exemption in the early days and the IRS pulled it and then they got it back in 1993. while going through that process again the IRS actually took issue with the fact that Scientology was claiming you could be a Scientologist and a member of another religion the IRS actually said pump the brakes there yeah if you're going to say that we're going to say you're not a religion yeah and they actually in put in writing to the IRS no no no no that's not what we meant that's not what we meant we meant in the beginning you can be both but eventually you just have to be a Scientologist so you mentioned the eight the eight Dynamics but you also mentioned survival so that seems to be a core principle that that human existence is about survival can you elaborate what is meant by survival are we talking about the survival of the human species survival of the individual humans survival of the manifestation of Satan's in human form what what do we what's survival so it would be all of that because survival is the the dominant Force across all the Dynamics that I mean L Ron Hubbard it was either Dianetics or science of survival he he says he discovered the principle upon which all life exists and that is all life no matter what it is trying to do are you ready Alex it's trying to survive that's pretty powerful that's pretty powerful that's it no I I got to tell you I gotta you might get me back in no I'm not I'm not trying to get you back in I'm trying to take you uh get you to take seriously the power of the ideas behind Scientology because I think those ideas are not bad ideas uh they resonate with a lot of ideas throughout philosophy through our religions throughout the history of human civilization the interesting aspect is how it goes wrong but here's the thing like here's the thing it is consistent with prior efforts or studies it's just that L Ron Hubbard said this was a watershed breakthrough that was being discovered for the first time that's kind of what I'm mocking really yeah but you can mock Nietzsche for saying man is Will To Power you can claim to be the first person to ever say it well Nietzsche he's had a bit of an ego so like and he's full of contradictions but I'm pretty sure the the imply thing is that he was the first first to say it yeah there's a lot of scientists there's a one of the people I really admire is Stephen Wolfram who uh wrote a a book called A New Kind of science that explores uh complex systems and cellular automata and these mathematical systems that have been explored before but he boldly kind of defined I am presenting to you a whole new way to look at the world and if you just set a little bit of the ego behind that aside there's actually beautiful ideas in there they have of course been done before and explored before but sometimes people declare the coolest that's the only thing I'm really mocking is yes this discovery that life is trying to survive is greater than the discovery of fire okay I mean it gets a little silly but that's fine we can agree that the fact that life is trying to survive has meaning and is Meaningful and can be is valuable and it's true I mean life is trying to survive also there's a non-trivial definition of what is life here so this idea of a thing the thing that permeates through lifetimes yeah through people there's some some fabric that is bigger than the individual biological bags of meat that's a philosophically interesting idea of course if it's not grounded in a little bit more uh a physical reality then it becomes a little to Google and the way I'll run Hubbard and Scientology defines survival is very much intertwined with how they Define ethics ethics anything you know to be ethical is pro survival to be unethical is counter survival but we were talking about just the concept of the Dynamics like what does survival refer to and it actually does refer to all of them but just keep in mind when it comes to the seventh Dynamic thetans collectively um involved in here's the idea that a thing cannot die there's no such thing as killing a thing nathane can only can only survive and so um anyway uh this concept of the Dynamics is one of the most fundamental and important Concepts in Scientology but but because I mentioned that it also gets tied up with ethics and this probably speaks to what you're just talking about is you can have the ideas and the concepts and you can have how do they go wrong because they hold that Scientology applying Scientology getting people into Scientology is the key to basically saving every spiritual being in existence when you're analyzing what is ethical it becomes whatever is good for Scientology becomes by definition ethical because anything that's good for Scientology which is a third Dynamic is inherently good for all the Dynamics so that's where you get the ends justifying the means to do any anything possible and use any means necessary to afford the aims of Scientology that's kind of where a lot of uh Soviet implementation of Communism went wrong is the ends justify the means the equality the justice for the workers uh if we have to kill murder in prison censor yeah in in the name of that then it's it's for the greater good in the long term to achieve the the ideal of Communism in some respects Scientology created a near-perfect communist experiment in its sea organization what is it from everyone according to their ability to reach according to their need or something like that Scientology C organization is damn near a perfect communist experiment coming from someone who doesn't necessarily know the perfect communist experiment really is because I'm not grew up in a cult Lex you can't use it as an excuse It's a funny tagline to use in my videos I like it but like it is interesting that an organization that is so hyper capitalist and so money hungry and is known to be very wealthy at its core is run by these group of seog members that live a communist lifestyle we're gonna jump around let's go what is sea org what is C organization what is this organization the C organization is the most dedicated version the most dedicated brand of scientologists so there's three like echelons of scientologists there's public who just live normal lives in the real world and they pay to do Scientology courses in auditing then there's staff members who also live in the Real Worlds uh but work on two and a half year contracts or five-year contracts at their local Scientology organization and then once they finish their contract there their debt is paid or whatever and then there's the sea org members these are the guys who signed the billion year contracts they don't have lives in the outside world they don't own property they live in Scientology provided housing they eat Scientology they eat Scientology run cafeterias is there an actual contract that says a billion years it's symbolic but yes okay like no it's not a legally enforceable contract they haven't succeeded in enforcing it in any subsequent lifetimes yet marriage contracts should be like that a billion years not until death to us part but a billion years it really makes it very concrete of what you're signing up for yeah those are the billion year guys you hear a lot about the billionaire contract the billion year contract that's the sea org and and uh all of Scientology Management International Management middle management Continental Management and even some lower level service orgs are one composed 100 of cork members you're not allowed to marry or date someone who's not in the sea org uh you're also not allowed to have children with anybody outside yoga in general you're not allowed to have children sea org members are not allowed to have children unless they leave the sea Arc if you they're you're expected to uh have an abortion and stay in the sea org because it's the greatest good for Scientology if you accidentally get pregnant interesting because it distracts from the focus of the work yeah what about sexual relations only once married but that's why people get married after like three days you're like hey you you look you look all right let's get married are you allowed to have divorce yeah you get divorced a lot in the sea org I've known people who get married divorced three times by like by the age of 25. oh wow because in this year getting married is practically like dating right also unless you're married you're living in dorms with a bunch of other people so in order to get your own room you also have to get married so there's many benefits oh wow okay so uh you mentioned communism in which way because there is there a hierarchy inside sea org is there a redistribution of uh influence position money power and sexy org everyone in this New York makes 50 a week everybody except David miscavige but right and and some uh some posts might have a cash bonus incentive structure but fundamentally their pay is 50 a week so so even the head of a big Scientology organization is getting 50 bucks a week our celebrities also part of seaworg or not usually so this is really the management layer so what's the idea behind fifty dollars a week is that basically live a humble life they don't have to give you anything at all it's just Oh you mean like what's the idea behind not paying yeah basically not paying everything you need is already being provided for you you're not here for the money you're working all the time anyway it's not like you don't have days off I mean you're you're working all the time there's there's not it's there's no concept of the weekends there's no oh thank God it's Friday Friday's just another day and how are the position the tasks the jobs uh allocated within the sea org what do you mean like like what kind of tasks you're doing what kind of stuff you're doing it's very similar to just any other um business as far as you can have your Human Resources you can have your sales you can have your accounting your operations your quality control it's just that in Scientology your operations is delivering courses and auditing so your operations and your quality control were most of the activity occurs as far as delivering Scientology and then you've got your you'd call it business development but that's just bringing in new members right so the the the the function of scientology's organization is very uh very comparable to a normal business in the normal world so let's talk about the products of this business auditing and courses so what's auditing so auditing is so we described earlier Dianetics auditing Scientology auditing is uh very similar to that so at first glance it it looks like Psychotherapy a kind of therapy all Scientology auditing is going to look like that it's one-on-one talk therapy uh you're in a a room by yourselves no distraction no noise one-on-one yeah like this yeah but and in Scientology they have what's called an e-meter who writes almost all auditing employs the use of any meter what's an e-meter so an e-meter is a device that just measures the resistance to a small electrical flow except scientologists believe that this emitter can be used to Simply direct the progress of an auditing session to determine whether uh the auditing has reached a good satisfactory conclusion uh all auditing sessions have to end on a satisfactory conclusion like that's the job of the auditor there's you don't just it's not like sorry the session sucked see you next week it's not like that every auditing session has to end um on a positive note and if it doesn't uh there's corrections to be made so um the e-meter what does it look like visually like oh you can pull it up pull up Mark eight e-meter Mark eight so there's a few dials you know there's a basic information about time and duration I'm presuming then a dial that just goes zero to something okay so let's say that the meter's in front of me and you're the one holding the cans I'm holding the cancel your enter you're doing the auditing of me yeah okay okay I'm holding the cans no literally in the beginning of an auditing session when you're calibrating the sensitivity sensitivity of the emitter you do like a can squeeze so I go squeeze the cans please okay so I'm just like squeezing yeah and I'm just changing the sensitivity because when you squeeze the cans I want to get about a one-third of a dial drop on the needle the idea is you don't want if the needle's too sensitive then every time you shift around in your chair the needle is going to bounce all over the place so you're trying to set the sensitivity to this thing and that's all the the knob there on the bottom to the left that's the sensitivity knob and that determines just uh how much how sensitive the needle is going to be and the the bigger dial is called the tone arm and that is changing uh I want to say voltage or current but I'm not intending I'm going to get one of those words that's wrong right but it is a real device it's a real device so you can actually calibrate uh to probably you know get an outcome that you want yeah so here's even how just how a Scientology auditor believes it works you're holding the cans there's a tiny little battery in that emitter that's sending you're completing the circuit when you pick up the cans right so you got a little thing going there and that needle will respond to your physical movement but that's not what we want we want you to sit the hell still so that we can read this thing when I'm asking you questions okay so you're sitting there still very still as still as you can comfortable right and I'm gonna go is there something you're withholding from me and what I'm looking for is right when I say at the end of me I'm looking for the needle to dip to the right having a needle even if it's kind of random can really be like um a catalyst for a conversation that's what it's used for except it's an enforced conversation so I'll give you a really good example of this so you're holding the cans say is there anything you're withholding from me and I get an instant read and I go is there anything you're worthholding for me you're gonna go I don't think so and I don't see the needle no you don't see the needle okay I go well what did you think of when I asked you the question now if you've already had a lot of auditing you know how this goes it means I got an instant read and we're not going to move on until this question gets resolved okay so you're gonna go I don't know what I was thinking of and then I'm gonna I'll be like you know take a look and I'll help you out here I'll try to steer you okay so I'm looking to get roughly the same read while you're thinking about whatever I mean what was that what was that right there and you can start digging to what you can start I just want an answer to the question okay and I can go to memory yeah and you can give me any answer you want there's no way for me to know if you're giving me the right answer but I want you to give me something yeah if you say you can't give me anything I'm going to keep using the emitter until you give me something yeah okay so let's say you give me something I'm gonna get all the details about that and until like time place form an event I want to know everything that happened I want to know all the details and by the way I'm writing all this down so I'm taking notes of everything you're telling me that it's a bad thing that you did that you haven't told me about okay so I'm keeping notes when you represent to me that you've told me everything there is to tell I'm looking for the needle to give like a smooth back and forth motion like this and Scientology calls that a floating needle that means in Scientology land we're done with that so now I might go back to check the question okay good I'll check the question again is there anything you're withholding from me oh if I get another read we got to go through the process again okay if you tell me I've told you everything and I don't get a floating needle I've got to go okay is there an earlier similar thing have you basically done an earlier similar thing is there an earlier similar time you haven't told someone something or is there an earlier similar thing that you did the thing that you just told me we're going to keep going earlier similar earlier similar earlier similar until I get a floating needle and that's where I'm explaining it this way you can see how no matter what the specific auditing session happens to be about there's still the potential in any auditing session that you're going into past lives yeah just because you have to go earlier similar until you get a floating needle okay now here's how scientologists think the emitter actually works meaning why does the emitter work so we talked before about these um these mental pictures right these recordings okay well we spoke about engrams just recordings of pain and unconsciousness well Scientology would hold the the bad recordings aren't the only recordings that you have those are just the recordings in your reactive mind you also have an analytical mind which is just your conscious memory conscious recording of everything from present time to the last 76 trillion years yeah and Hubbard would say that these memories are actually a perfectly detailed recording and these does like 56 perceptions or something and that it's perfect and you can access that information you just have trouble doing so okay so he says that these recordings these mental pictures have actual electrical charge and Mass now you asked before is there any actual physics in this I don't know where are you supposed to store the pictures of your last 76 trillion years that have charge in Mass I don't see it but Hubbard says it's there okay so he says that these things have mass and when you recall them or put attention on them you create an electrical flow which maybe through magnetic fields or whatever impinges upon the electrical flow of the emitter and it shows up as a read on the needle that's how Scientology that's how scientologists believe that's why the needle reads now cynics would say the needle only reads on Palm sweat and movement well I know that's not true right I can't tell you everything the needle does read on but I can tell you it's not just moving your hands in sweaty hands it does correlate to thoughts probably some way somehow because if it didn't correlate to thoughts that this process would be way way too inefficient because it would it would be 200 there there's going to be a bunch of people who are just not you're not going to get the what is it called the floating needle like no matter what I can't explain to you how you get a floating needle but it sure as hell isn't hand sweat and it sure as hell isn't squeezing the cans right so you eventually most people will get to the floating needle and some you get floating needles there's like a feed there probably is a feedback mechanism that you will each person realizes how their mind and body yeah because you want a resolution right it's probably you want your needle to float for both people yes and it's probably a great experience when you're like yes it's a gamified feeling right well when you're training on how to use the e-meter there are drills where you practice generating with your mind various needle reactions so you know there is a drill where you sit there and you consciously try to create a floating needle by recalling happy thoughts go to your happy place and at the end of every auditing session you actually have to go to an a third party sit down in front of an email and verify that your needle is floating nice every single auditing session not only has to end on a floating needle but then you have to go to someone else and have the floating needle verified any Scientologist who's uh a seasoned recipient of auditing knows how to make their needle float at The Examiner got to be honest though this process again sorry to be sort of going there but um it feels like this is a very uh rigorous talk therapy session is there good aspects to this sure a lot of people find auditing very helpful I mean I've heard some describe it as quite thoroughly addictive me personally I never enjoyed getting auditing that's probably more a function of having been raised in it and it was never something I wanted to do something that was forced on me as a child you know and also I was never I don't like talking about private secret stuff like you kind of you kind of have to want to be an open book sure to to honestly and thoroughly participate in an auditing session because there's not necessarily A belief that this is going to be private there's no expectation of privacy but there's no expectation that your stuff's going to be leaked for blackmail either I mean you kind of you trust the people in the organization even despite rumors and stuff like that but the rumors are coming from people that are lying to you essentially if you're a Scientologist and you're participating in participating in an auditing session you know that anyone in the organization is has the ability to know the stuff that you talk it's not like oh my God I'm only telling my auditor because I think no one's ever going to know you know that people know but you also trust the organization how quickly does it go to past memories for people who are seasoned like they actually like going past life yeah I I hated it I would make sure I was really good at making my needle float I didn't want to have some auditor because I never believed in the past life memories yeah so I didn't want to be in that impassable you know reach an impasse in an auditing session where I was being asked for something I couldn't provide because I knew this auditing session has to end on a good point but scientologists enjoy for the most part going they call it whole track whole track is past life going whole track your time track they call it the time track is your whole memory but whole track refers to anything past life okay so going whole track or deep hole track with high reality meaning it's not like oh I have a fuzzy memory and I'm not sure if it's real like your real season scientologists are like oh yeah I was on this planet oh this time circling this before that I was eating for breakfast fascinating before the origin of life on Earth so so billions of years ago on a distant planet what you were eating for breakfast or other universes I wonder if that's a nice shortcut to sneak up to actual trauma that happened to you as a therapy device I just so putting Scientology aside I just I'm thinking about as a technique for therapy discussing basically you know some people have trauma and one of the things you do with therapy is like bring the trauma to the surface that's the stuff that happened to your childhood maybe it's a more convenient thing to do to kind of map that indirectly onto a fictitious telling of what happened to you something like that trauma on a distant planet elsewhere it could be it could be a nice way to sneak up to it yeah and it goes both flows there not just things that have happened to you but things that you've done so you know you could be being asked for you know you'd be going back to I wiped out a civilization I don't know this race on this planet oh wow oh yeah but so you can actually take on a whole new guilt oh yeah so I I okay all right you might actually take on a lot more guilt and let go of because if you feel like that self-critical aspect of the brain boy because I'm my brain is really self-critical so I could see myself manufacturing if I was forced to over time some kind of story where I did genocide a whole population of like Pluto or something at a different distant is somewhere in Alpha Centauri yeah so I mean and now I walk around with that guilt wait am I actually a horrible person so imagine though if you had not only are you looking at you know if someone's being self-critical trying to identify destructive patterns of behavior in your present life but what if you really internalize the fact that I haven't only been this way for 40 years I've been this way for 40 trillion years yeah but Scientology would argue that as a Satan you're inherently good all things are basically good so the the goal of the auditing procedure there would be essentially to figure out find the moment find what it was that caused you to make that shift as a being to dramatize you know evil intentions and stuff like that so even if you're going whole track looking at all the horrible things you've done the goal is to find like well what happened just prior to that what was like the prior confusion and what what did you misunderstand just before that and whatnot so the goal is basically so scientologists after a lot of auditing are also convinced that they have fixed the reason for any non-optimum conduct and underlying this is a belief that at the core we're all good yes there's a lot of really powerful ideas in Scientology which is so interesting that it goes wrong yeah okay uh what about the training you mentioned the training of the auditor that's really interesting so what's how lengthy is that process it can take years I mean one of that question I want to ask is are people in Sea org like as an auditor do you believe everything how much um is there a crisis of faith that Creeps in in religion you have a crisis of faith when you start to wonder like does God even exist so in this case how often do you start to doubt that some of the core beliefs of Scientology are false Scientology would say that Scientology is not about beliefs it's about a application of the techniques of Scientology auditing to improve someone's spiritual awareness and ability so the belief level of Scientology is pretty much the stuff we've already discussed the effectiveness of the auditing process so the effectiveness of the auditing process is one of the things Hubbard says is that standard Tech standard Scientology they call it the tech the technology of how to deliver auditing standard Tech Works 100 of the time when applied 100 correctly well that's kind of unfalsifiable right yeah because anytime it doesn't work it wasn't applied correctly exactly that's a nice little uh escape hatch to pull on having a crisis of faith it didn't work well then obviously it wasn't applied correctly that's where quality control comes in their job is to nitpick and you can always find one thing that wasn't done correctly communism uh didn't work because it wasn't implemented correctly it's the it's always it's always it's always an escape hatch with ideologies that's right sure that's right I would probably argue that Auditors um are not in a position of having many crisis of Faith because actually they're usually seeing people for the most part improve in some ways through the process of auditing now auditing can create like a state somewhat of a euphoric State you feel great you're just blown out of your head you know you feel on top of the world I've had that in some of my auditing as an auditor sorry no as a person receiving auditing okay and so my point is as an auditor doing a lot of auditing you know you're going to have someone in front of you called the the pre-clear is the person in front of you who's getting the auditing called the PC or the pre-clear they see over and over and over again these PCS having these sort of euphoric States and floating needles and I feel great and fantastic oh thanks you saved my life like I've always said if Scientology if people didn't find Scientology helpful nobody would ever stay in Scientology right and so Auditors are pretty much the ones doing the heavy lifting of what it even means to be a Scientologist those guys aren't the ones that you end up um having crisis of faith I mean doing Scientology auditing it doesn't require that you believe just have faith that you believe something you just have to go through these motions and scientologists one of the reasons scientologists think this is all scientific is because it's like I don't care if you believe why this works I care how you feel at the end of an auditing session and empirically speaking like anecdotal data is it actually seems to improve people's lives within the context so taking the outside world out of it within this particular organization you're actually measurably seeing Improvement yes is that is that some degree real because like if you look at a book like Animal Farm where the pigs start to rule the other animals and over time the life of the animals gets worse and worse and worse while the pigs keep saying that's actually getting better and better and better again communism same thing the the rationing is getting worse and worse and worse less and less food but just constant reporting uh that there's more and more food where we're winning hashtag I would argue that what you've just described it could be an identical description of what it feels like and what it means to go up scientology's bridge to total freedom you are reinforcing to yourself that everything's getting better and better and better and and you'd be like you don't spend time with your family anymore yeah you're broke even though you make a lot of money you're always stressed you're you're at the beck and call of these people who seem to run your run your lives like how a Scientologist feels about their own life is um it's very interesting to compare that to how that person's life looks to their non-scientology family members I get contacted by a lot of people who've never been in Scientology but like I got a family member who's who's really deep and I just can you help me understand some things why is this person's life like this why is this person's life like this so I I don't want to say that scientologists do not actually I don't want to say oh it's all on their heads they think they're being helped but they're really not that doesn't feel honest you know but it's this thing where if Scientology was just getting auditing when you wanted about the subjects you wanted and you could take it or leave it that would be fine it's it's the fact that it's part and parcel to this entire organization and this entire experience that has as a part of that experience taking everything from you demanding everything from you controlling who you can speak with controlling who you can have relationships with who you have to erase from your life this is where and it's hard to it's hard to place one pinpoint on this is where Scientology goes wrong it's really hard to do that because the good parts of Scientology and the bad parts of Scientology are all just Scientology yeah so there's definition was bad for you and it's probably in the beginning is bad for you um this almost just sounds like a template of a toxic relationship you know there's a bunch of stuff in this world that's just not good for you so the uh the authority the authoritarian says like I'm just protecting you by blocking you off from those negative things and they're probably they are probably negative things but then this like uh this Freedom starts closing in to where you can't no longer speak freely think freely act freely and there's some I mean that's why sort of power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely that person doing the controlling actually starts getting that like dopamine Rush of the controller that's exciting and it's a vicious negative cycle so you start out as it it starts out good because you're trying to do good for the person um but then it somehow goes to shit yeah so what what uh what are the aspects that just that are often controlled about about a person who's in Psychology especially sea work well information control access to the internet access to any information critical of Scientology is some internet access load public Scientologist has no restrictions to their access to the internet they're just not allowed to read anything critical of Scientology oh okay so there's self they're supposed to self-control what they read or not and what's the explanation is is it always assumed that anything critical Scientology is a lie they really push this thing that uh unless you've been in a Scientology organization yourself or unless you've actually been a Scientologist You couldn't possibly know the truth about scientology if you're only getting information from people who aren't members or former members then you couldn't possibly be getting the correct information now they they don't realize the math there doesn't make sense if you can find out the true information by becoming and being a Scientologist then that means you can get the correct information from a former Scientologist because they traveled that path and they got the correct information so they still create this on they try to create this unfalsifiable Loop where unless you are personally doing it you don't have correct information and you go what about the people who did personally do it got the correct information left and are now sharing that with others well no those are lies well okay so so just anything you don't like is a lie then you know yeah pretty much that's kind of how that's kind of how it works so what about the control of negative information on the internet uh what like the actual operations I I I've you know preparing I should admit I don't know too much about scientology I was doing a bunch of reading and the Wikipedia page on Scientology interestingly enough is not that negative about scientology um so like it made me ask you know you have to be a little bit careful how you consume stuff from Wikipedia you have to consider because money can buy things there there's there's certain special interests and so on but like it made me wonder like like with a lot of controversial topics what is true and where do I look uh where do I go for truth so like how much sort of deliberate action is there to control what is true on the internet by Scientology well these days they've pretty much I think thrown in the towel but they have the Scientology middle management was editing Wikipedia so often from IP addresses that were traced back to the Scientology buildings that uh Wikipedia locked them out from any IP addresses associated with Scientology from being able to edit it it's like the Scientology was so infatuated with trying to control the information and in the early days of the internet they had a certain degree of success with that they just it's just hopeless these days it's the scale the scale is not there but actually I'm very surprised how uh bot Farms how effective they can be at a very small scale if you just pay 100 people just spread narratives but the the the the bad stuff the the reason that's effective is you can kind of create conspiracy theories that create chaos and nobody knows what is true that bot Farms can do but actually really nicely control a narrative is hard so to create chaos it's easier to do to to basically say like um you know do PR control is very hard yeah so especially on the internet especially when the critical eye is there the internet can smell bullshit which is one of the really really powerful things about the internet and I gotta tell you it's one of the reasons I do my YouTube channel it's one of the reasons I decided to upload every day I've uploaded every day for the last six months I just wanted there to be a Non-Stop flow of information of any kind in any variety as long as it's fair and balanced intelligent interesting that scientologists who stumble upon the internet will go oh look someone's talking about my thing let's see what they got going on and and I I know this guy the fact that Scientology crushes so much information but before before YouTube before like I have the only like big Scientology Channel and that only got big in the last six months okay so before that there were channels there was things but it's almost like it took a lot of uh like people felt like it took a lot of bravery and courage to like say something on the Internet about scientology and so people would pop up and there weren't very many voices and I was like I want this to be prolific I want I want to be prolific I want to have 30 or 40 other channels being prolific so that Scientology couldn't possibly successfully control the narrative about it have you been personally attacked aaronsmithlevin.com is a website created by the Church of Scientology have you seen that no what kind of content is on there oh Aaron's an abusive father and a horrible husband and the worst staff member we've ever had and um oh I openly talk about it because I think the fact that Scientology even does things like that is fucking hilarious yeah and uh anything they try to do to me the way I think about it is you know you're just giving me an opportunity to turn the mirror back on you and show everyone how horrible you are does it stick no so you find that there is ineffective it's completely ineffective they're so over the top and um well I'll tell you how the website even came into being so I was on the first season of Leah Remini Scientology in the aftermath every single person who participated in that show got a website it's just that everyone else's website is like who is markheadly.com who is Mike render.com well I bought who is aaronsmithlevin.com but I was too stupid to buy Aaron I didn't buy aaronsmith 11.com so I'm actually the only one who has a website in their name oh nice yeah and I'm like completely got a lawyer to get it back for me but I'm like why I want everyone to see what a nasty Petty disgusting organization that this is and nobody believes anything Scientology says anyway does the general public know that it comes from Scientology it says right on the bottom copyright 2000 whatever Church of Scientology International like they didn't even try to hide it so aaronsmithlevin.com yeah a man with no moral compass Aerosmith who is he really Aaron Smith Levin a man with no moral compass read about Aaron Smith Levins an angry man spreading hate from from the internet's Shadows open mouth shot and you're saying like at the wow there's there's testimonies oh there's videos from former co-workers the slightest thing just sets him off and he just goes totally nuts well that one is true I didn't understand why you slapped me before the interview got links to everyone love this website on the bottom it's so funny okay 2021 in terms of Scientology International All Rights Reserved here's an example of just scientology's complete lack of self-awareness so me and Mike rinder we went have these on like a house flip project right you know hi grinder you know Mike render do I you gave me a bobble head of the guy um I don't I don't know him I just I would like to talk to him about him but this uh there's a very fine gentleman here with a bobble head the reason we agreed that the bobble head is because on Mike rinder's hate site Scientology created a gif or a gif how do you set what's the right way to say it the correct way is GIF GIF good yeah Scientology created a gif of Mike rinder as a bobble head it was an insult like oh all he does is sit next to Leah Remini and go yes Leah yes Leah and so they they made a gif of him with a bobble head so we were like we're gonna make Mike rinder bobble heads and we're gonna sell them on the spshop.com to raise money for the aftermath Foundation I love it yeah and now that I go out and buy yeah go to the ice cream shop.com and get yourself a micron or bobblehead now look now that my profile's getting a little higher this Head was made to Bobble like this yeah this smooth shiny head needs its own bobble head now it does 100 does I can't believe it doesn't exist so but let me show you so here's What's Happening Here we just hired some day laborers off of what like Craigslist or something yeah so what Scientology did was they had a private investigator stake out that the house flip project they were clearly running license plates of anyone who visited the property because otherwise otherwise how would they find out the laborers names look do background checks on them to find out they had criminal records and they published this as if it's going to reflect negatively on me oh we hired someone to do work who had a criminal record who gives a shit do you know one of the biggest problems people with records have is finding employment there's nothing bad about hiring someone who's got a criminal record it doesn't reflect negatively on me but it shows you what they think about those people it shows you what they think about people who are trying to put their lives back together and maybe you know actually work for a living and it also shows that they're surveilling us like like they don't realize that putting this up they're publishing information that they could only have if they're surveilling me and Mike and it doesn't occur to them maybe we shouldn't put that up just the general process sad to say of Journalism where they're looking for any kind of dirt and it's they're trying to conjure up a story and there's something about drama and negative stories that get clicks and so on so this is a general process the more especially the more celebrity you become the more these kinds of attacks come and they they look for any kind of thing that could be you know it doesn't even have to be facts it could be just asking who is he really seems to have traction on the internet yeah what is the actual truth of the man you you keep claiming you are of the good man you keep claiming you are right it's fascinating uh but sometimes that can be effective uh but I think if you're being transparent and authentic and just putting yourself out there completely in their story completely then that's the best way to fight it that's the other reason to be prolific on the internet right the reason Joe Rogan can't get canceled is because anyone can watch thousands of hours of the authentic Joe Rogan you can't misrepresent him because he spend thousands of hours representing himself genuinely yeah the nice thing when you representing yourself generally you should be a good person so if you're a good person then the internet will know you can smell out the bullshit who is David moscowage it's even like because you said L Ron Harbor founded Scientology yeah let's go to the story of how we transition from that to Dear miscarriage the current leader of Scientology uh he was actually not selected by El Ron Hubbard to take over but ended up usurfing power and taking over this sounds like Stalin and Trotsky similar story it's the it's the person oftentimes in the situation uh it's not the natural successor to power it's the one that takes power right I think the quote sometimes it gets attributed to David miscavige's um power power is not given it is assumed yeah something like that the last six years of Alvin Hubbard's life he was often a seclusion essentially hiding from lawsuits now by the time Hubbard went off into seclusion miscavige had sort of already risen up through the ranks of the sea organization now miscavige was like a teenager either like 11 12 13 or something like that miscavage was not born into Scientology but he was a young a young boy when his father got into Scientology okay so miscavige did start working as a sea org member so there's one organization that existed to essentially serve Hubbard directly and to represent his interest and that was called The Commodore he was the Commodore of the sea organization The Commodores Messengers organization we're gonna call it the CML miscavige started working for the CMO um pretty early on in his sea org career by the way as did Mike render mini mic okay and so he just became known as a doer like a guy who'll get it done no excuses no stops you know get it done so he had made a name for himself in the CMO around the time by the time probably went off into seclusion now when he went off into seclusion he took two other CMO or I'm going to call him Messengers right commodore's Messengers he took two other Messengers with him patent any broker now it has been said by people Mike Mike rinder has told me he goes the reason Pat and Annie went off with lrh isn't necessarily because he desperately wanted them to but partly because we could afford to let them go we didn't necessarily need them sure okay and between the two of them Annie was the one who was like a really compassionate person intelligent person caring person was there a possible trajectory of this world where she was the one that took over yes in fact uh Pat and Annie broker were the two people that were supposed to take over okay but because Pat and Annie were with Hubbard in seclusion miscavige basically had the complete run of the operation without any oversight from Hubbard the only way any information would get from Scientology world to Hubbard is miscavige and patbroker would meet at a confidential location and miscavige would give broker any information he wanted to go to lrh so if miscavage wanted to get rid of somebody all he had to do was feed lrh false information that this person was doing had been caught doing something treasonous and then he would get in response some order from L Ron Hubbard to get rid of this person having to so are there so many similarities between various communist regimes and fascist regimes well Hitler did the same thing when he uh became the supreme leader he had to take power yeah had to wait for the president to die but the whole the whole time there's a control of information and and a slow aggregation of power of course with Nations is different because if you control the military you control a lot so there's you have to also get the generals on your side and so on but I'm sure in this situation there is similar kind of Dynamics you have to get certain people on your side control the flow of information uh let the original founder the original leader die off yeah and make sure that you are the one that's left with the power right so whereas Pat and Annie are off with lrh all of scientology's attorneys and accountants and lobbyists and whatever they all know Dave Dave's the one they deal with so you know lrh passes away Pat and Annie make this appearance nobody knows Pat Nanny everybody knows Dave and so he ended up getting rid of Pat and Nanny this is a very short perhaps slightly bastardized version of it of miscavige basically they had been they had been um ushering just suitcases of cash to lrun Hubbard during this time and you know like so you have miscavige handing boatloads of cash to Pat broker Pat would do crazy things like hide the money in the walls of houses and dig pits and everything so miscavige basically threatened to turn Pat broker over to the IRS for tax evasion that's pet broker's still alive is he a Scientologist or no no he basically went away and kept about it she died a handful of years ago she stayed a loyal sea org member until the very end but literally like Miss gavage put her on menial tasks like like she had no Authority whatsoever she was just put on menial tasks the washing dishes but not really groundskeeper just just stupid low-level assistant paper pusher stuff she never she never operated with any actual Authority even though she was supposed to be the one to take over her and Pat so on David miscavige difficult question but can you make uh both the case that he is a good man who's misunderstood and the case that he's not a good man first of all I believe that miscavige is a True Believer in Scientology I do believe that that's a really important uh question do you think he believes in all the thetans and and all of that he definitely believes in that I think he believes in Scientology but in a different way than all other scientologists because he's aware of a lot more information yeah damaging information about L Ron Hubbard and the true story of Scientology than most people so his version of belief is different I'll give you one example here so scientology's bridge to total freedom goes up to what they call ot8 operating thing in level eight okay scientologists have all been told that L Ron Hubbard before he passed finished completed putting together OT 910 11 12 13 14 and 15. it's just sitting in the vault waiting to be released this is part of the Scientology belief system because remember I said growing up scientology's Bridge of total freedom is how you're supposed to get back to your native god-like state while all the scientologists in the world who've already done ot8 know that they haven't gotten there but they still believe in Scientology because they're told there's more but wait there's more Miss kavich knows there is no more so miscavige knows the fundamental promise of being able to achieve full operating thetan is a lie he knows L Ron Hubbard didn't accomplish that so therefore no one else is going to accomplish it as well if L Ron Hubbard had accomplished it Miss gavage knows well he didn't write it up he didn't leave instructions for how anyone else would accomplish it so no matter what miscavige knows that the fundamental promise that what Scientology is saying they will be able to deliver to mankind is a lie now it's going to sound like I'm contradicting myself because it sounds like I'm saying well he knows it's bullshit I think he believes that L Ron Hubbard just failed to finish his work and he's kind of hoping over on Harper is going to come back to finish the job because elrond Hubbard did tell the people at International the International Management base at least a core of them that he was coming back now we know that David miscavige believed this because right around the 21 year mark he was supposed to come back like 21 years after he died right around the 21 year mark David miscavige was getting busy putting some things in place that had to get done in case El Ron Hubbard came back so we know he at least believed to that level Because he believes that like El Ron Hubbard can sort of enter his own body no that's not how it works in Scientology okay so you can't have a transfer of Satan's if you were full OT you could can you uh describe the OT against OT levels OT one two three four five to the eight what um what are they what's how do you get to level one I'm gonna answer this question by first connecting some dots yes okay um we spoke early in the interview about achieving your native god-like yeah state that in Scientology is called native state okay native state and full operating thetent mean the exact same thing okay because that native state you are a fully operating thetan you know operating meaning operating in your full capacity so OT means operating thing so the upper confidential half a Scientology Bridge are called the OT levels the operating thing levels and these and remember they're confidential so most scientologists have not done these levels they don't know what's on them it is on these levels that you learn about the zenu and the body thetan story can you describes you know please we spoke earlier about how at the lower non-confidential levels of scientology's bridge Hubbard is saying that what's wrong with you is your reactive mind yes okay well in Scientology once you've gotten rid of your reactive mind that is what's called the state of clear okay so after you finish state of clear the next thing on the bridge is the OT levels well if you've already gotten rid of your active mind what the heck are you supposed to do now well now L Ron Hubbard says Okay first what was wrong with you was just your reactive mind but now the next thing you have to resolve the next thing that's wrong with you is you actually have tens of thousands of of thetans stuck to your body and they all have their own reactive Minds you have to audit the thetans how do you order the things are these like different shades of your inner mind and you just have to try to access them somehow you use the e-meter just like we spoke about except now you've got a divider that separates the cans so they don't short circuit and you hold both cans in one hand and you have the emulator in front of you so now you're auditing yourself you're telepathically talking to the things that are stuck to you you're thinking the commands instead of saying them out loud and you sort of do drills where you practice looking for emitter reads at the instant you have a thought you're telepathically auditing spirits that L Ron Hubbard says are stuck to your body does this sound like a recipe for a mental breakdown or a heck of a mental Journey wherever that leads it's a good lead anywhere it'd probably lead to a very bad place right very often does and you combine that with the fact that Scientology is against any forms of mental help or health outside of Scientology and you have a recipe for disaster now you might go where did all these spirits come from that are stuck to your body this is where Xenu comes into play so Hubbard says that 75 million years ago Xenu was basically a dictator at the galactic Confederation is like 70 something or 80 something planets sit somewhere in the Milky Way and uh Xenu was like a dictator an Overlord for either one of these planets or the whole system and they had a population problem and Xenu was like we need to get rid of like half the people so we called them all in for tax audits Alvin Hubbard didn't like the IRS so of course the story has to do with tax audits okay call them all in for tax audits said psych bitches froze them in glycol loaded them up on Space planes flew them to Earth remember the story has to be Earth because the story is what's wrong with us flew them to Earth dropped them in volcanoes blew them up with hydrogen bombs and then captured them with like Spirit magnets I'm making up words because okay um and these disembodied spirits of these people that got blown up have just been blown in the wind here on Earth and they attach themselves to things and they can be in the environment and they stick to bodies and everything and so and they all have reactive Minds so at scientology's upper levels if you get sick or you have cancer or there's something wrong with you Scientology will say that's one of your body things you need to get some auditing to fix the body thing so this story uh you do it with a kind of bit of a chuckle but when done seriously so it's just told in a serious way like to like or written down you read it by most accounts scientologists struggle when they read this for the first time because this is not consistent with what scientologists are hoping for is on their T levels they're hoping for some real life-changing magic the way these things are described and sold they're remember they're hoping that these OT levels are going to make them give them the ability to go like completely independent of their body at will yeah exteriorize from your body go back into your body you know like I have some real Spirit Powers the first is kind of a shock this is but then you still probably believe you hope yeah and you might be you might turn into on yourself self-critical that this is I'm just not strong enough yet yeah because also part of the Scientology remember it works 100 of the time when used 100 correctly and if it doesn't it could be because something's not being done right but it also could be because you're you're doing bad things that you're not telling people about like if you're committing present time over its crimes sins scientologists will be like that's part of the reason auditing isn't working on you is because you're committing criminal behavior that you're not being honest about so every Scientologist is sort of incentivized to to make auditing work on them okay now Lex this work is a little crazy on ot3 you learn about the OT the body things for the first time when you finish ot3 you attest to having achieved this state of having no more body things and then you start o24 and he's like psych you got more you got more BTS except those other BTS they had drug problems and that's why you couldn't find them the first time so we're gonna do a little something a little different here do something a little different there got to get rid of these BTS that were addicted to drugs okay then you finish ot4 and you're thinking man I hope you got the good stuff soon and then you get to ot5 and he's like psych you got more BTS you couldn't find these BTS because they were all bunched up together in clusters and first you have to break up the Clusters and then you can get rid of the BTS and you're like okay gotta do that and this was all El Ron Hubbard approved yeah this is from L Ron Hubbard and then after you finish ot5 you get rid of all the BT clusters ot6 is just a training course to teach you how to auto ot7 well t7 is now more BTS except it's in in the environment and stuff you're trying to locate BTS you can find them on your body but it's just more BTS okay and then ot8 is remember we talked about in all these auditing sessions throughout the entire Scientology Bridge you have people who've run hundreds or thousands of past life whole track incidents these memories have become part of their self-identity of who they even think they are ot8 you go through all these past life recalls and essentially I'm oversimplifying this a little bit he goes psych all those past life memories weren't yours they were your BTS and he goes now that you've discovered this now you know who you are not and you are ready to find out who you really are well now you're supposed to find out who you really are on ot9 and 10. those don't exist do we know they don't exist yes in fact the whole story of how that became known is part of how David miscavige was able to get rid of Pat broker and take over power because it was believed that Pat broker had met was in possession of the upper unreleased OT levels and when miscavige determined that he was not and there weren't in fact any levels that was bad that was a bad day to be David miscavige because he now knew he had something on his hands he could not get himself out of he's like so there's no Gap for Faith to seep in that there is um a level 9 and 10 11 and 12. oh the faith is there scientologists believe that these things do exist yeah Ron Hubbard didn't leave anything behind does David miscavige believe they exist oh no he knows he knows they don't exist no meaning when I say exist oh I don't mean do Advanced um uh levels of spiritual awareness exist when I said is it means did L Ron Hubbard write down what anyone is supposed to do that's called ot9 that doesn't exist so you're saying David miscarriage believes that they can be written down so they exist sort of in the platonic sense and El Ron Hubbard is the only one that can write it down so his face is really deep Oh you mean his faith that only El Ron Hubbard could have ever been the one to do it the full principles beliefs of uh Scientology he is do you have are you sure he believes that what exactly everything about scientology is that it's true to the best of my ability to know that I believe it to be true like I'll give you small even stupid examples like Mike renders told a story where at the international base miscavige actually had like a copper a Contraption built into the ground like grounded in the ground to come out where you could hold it and if something he sort of came up with to uh your BT it could ground your BTS could get your BTS that if you're feeling overstimulated or something I'm probably slightly bastardizing this story but he came up with this as a great idea something to help someone destimulate if their BTS were getting a little too overactive used now so that that's a stupid story that's sort of like well it shows you he believes in the concept of BTS if he's creating little rods to get rid of them to ground them into the Earth well he could be Conjuring up the stories because uh he understands the power of myth and narrative and so on to uh to inspire sure to but like but also if we look at history both with um just an interesting thing because I've been reading a lot about Hitler and Stalin and it seems like both of them in different ways believed in uh the stories they were telling even when the stories this is the fascinating especially with Hitler and propaganda where they were literally conjured up at first but then you start to believe you're in propaganda uh with Stalin I think what he always believed is the bigger idea of pure communism and anything justifies the journey to communism because it will ultimately be good for Humanity to achieve the state of pure communism and then he's a god-like figure that can can bring uh can bring Humanity there but like well Hitler it's interesting because like this constant propaganda that he knows is not true a little bit there's got to be doubt but then he like that all doubt is removed very quickly yeah so I guess humans are just this is how they operate yeah the conversation about David miscavige gets really interesting because I could give you a if I wanted to make the argument that he didn't believe I could give you a dozen examples to to make that argument I just happen to think that uh he believes in a different way whereas your average Scientologist believes that Alvernon Hubbard was practically infallible that he thought of everything in advance he took care of everything before he left and miscavige still believes in like the main structure of this thing but he's like oh shit it's falling to me to figure out how to actually make this thing happen I I think Miss gavage sees himself as someone who has to a certain degree had to go back and fix I'll run Hubbard's mistakes do you think he sees himself as doing good for the world I do what about for the people of Scientology I think in his own way he does I don't think he wakes up thinking he's um screwing scientologists I think he sees everyone else as screwing him I think he sees uh that he that it is his job to expand Scientology throughout the world and accomplish the aims of Scientology and he sees that it's not happening and he thinks if everyone else would just stop if everyone else would get out of his way and stop creating problems for him it would happen like uh I I do think he seems to sees himself as someone who is doing good I think that's fair to say I think the evidence shows that what about the effects of clearly power and influence that he's had and money yeah without question that has served as a corrupting force it has without question have you seen sort of evidence of that that he's changed over time after the 1993 IRS exemption that Scientology won back um and this information comes from Mike rinder uh that's when David miscavige as soon as the checks on his power were removed miscavig's Behavior changed markedly can you tell the story of Shelley miscavige and the Mystery surrounding her I saw that there is quite a bit of mystery yeah so Shelley miscavich for many years held the job of her post in the sea organization was David miscavige's assistant that was her post it's important to truly understand that and what that means because um the fact that she was miscavige's wife is meaningless and this is something that's hard to for regular people in the regular world to truly grasp how meaningless it is in Scientology for sea org members who are spouses it means nothing Your Role matters more in within seaworg your role is the only thing that matters so let's say let's say if Shelley was married to Dave but she worked in a different organization she would never be seen with him ever publicly ever wouldn't travel with him wouldn't go to events with him nothing sometime around 2006 2007 and I'm very oversimplifying this okay Shelley basically pissed off Dave to the point where he's like okay I'm done with you I'm gonna take you off of your post okay at that point she was reassigned to another confidential Scientology base up in Twin Peaks California um why am I the reason I'm providing this type of detail is because we hear that Shelley's missing yeah okay well you realize the same people who report the Shelley's Mission are also the same people who will tell you exactly where she is okay she works at this secretive CST Church of spiritual technology base out in Twin Peaks California I have personal confirmation that she was seen and spoken with by someone who knew her well in I'll say 2019. Shelley miscavige is missing in the sense that she's hasn't been seen with David miscavige since about 2006. but because she's no longer his assistant you would never see her with him as opposed to like the mystery of of a person that might be murdered this is more of a reallocation within the organization certain people who cover Scientology who have published stories where Shelley's miscavige's family member told a story to another family member who told the story to a friend who told the story to a former Scientologist who told the story to a journalist who published the story has created the impression that some of Shelley miscavige's family members are actually talking to the Press when in fact that has never occurred and so the very people who are publishing about Shelley miscavich missing have contributed to the fact that Shelley miscavige does no longer speak to those family members because she thinks they're talking to the Press when they never have it's pretty messed up it's sad that she because those those family members what would be a way for her to to recover to to flourish as a human being to escape yeah so I believe the information that I have that I verified I'm I'm putting out I'm the one representing it's true without revealing my sources sure that Shelley was still actively in touch regularly with family members outside of the sea organization since about until about 2014. so I mean regularly okay so there's no question about her safety or uh during that period and then someone else who knew Shelley very well uh did see her and actually have a conversation with her in a public place in uh 2019 or 2020. now somebody could still come along and be like how do we know she's okay it's been three years yeah okay you could say that about anybody you know there there's a the nature of working in the highest levels of Scientology management at these super secretive bases uh it's a very weird and unique situation yeah it has isolation baked in house secrecy enforced why why is secret why is everybody uh holding on to their stories so hard so so intensely people that are within the organization like it's hard to leak information oh they wouldn't want to leak they're true believers they see they see like there's a there's sort of a conspiracy theory that runs right through all of Scientology which is that Scientology um represents like an existential threat to the powers that really control that really control this planet do they have a face to the powers that really control do they have names to it like who's controlling it's Z news homies well I'm sure that's not what they say Xeno embodied it's actually sort of a multi-faceted um conspiracy and that on the one hand I'll Ron Hubbard points his fingers at like the international bankers okay which has shades of anti-Semitism too and then the IRS system is going to be quickly baked in I don't know the IRS now the the IRS is so low on the totem pole oh as far as the I mean the international Bankers he would say runs everything got it but they but use that that these Bankers um also use big Pharma and big psych to control the population and Scientology is famously against um Pharma and psych and so this is sort of how L Ron Hubbard characterizes like this big war between Scientology that's trying to set everyone free and big Pharma and big psych that's trying to enslave everyone on the planet yeah controlling their mind controlling their body through chemicals and and who controls the Press big Pharma and big psych so there's a lot of correlation to other kinds of conspiracy theories yeah um oh that's fascinating but you asked the question um where uh why would all these people hold on to their stories they don't they would never want to leak like by even anyone who would want a leak would not even want to be a Scientologist anymore like if you truly believe if you truly believe in Scientology and you got your shoulder to the wheel and you're a cork member you think Scientology is literally the only thing that can save every being on this planet from a fate of Eternal Amnesia and slavery yeah right and so it's like I mean you've seen The Matrix right so you've got everyone once you're unplugged from The Matrix and you realize yeah you can get plugged back in and live your nice life but you're a slave that's how scientologists see this planet they actually they refer to Earth as a Prison Planet just an individual level how is it possible to reach a person like that I is there something you could say to that like what's the Journey of reaching a person like that I personally because because when I when I was in those shoes I say there's nothing anybody could have said to me to get me to change how I felt and thought about scientology it's almost foolproof that the more evidence you try to present that there's something wrong with what Scientology is doing the more you're just working for the Sykes you know it's very very difficult I mean most people who leave Scientology leave because they have ex had some personal experience that was just such a grave Injustice that it just pushed them Beyond uh the point of what they're willing to experience very I've never I'm not sure I've really ever heard a story of someone going yeah I just woke up you know I just gradually realized it was all Bs and drifted away you know it's usually like no I really believed and they treated me so horribly I almost had no choice but to leave and then the stories get pretty crazy meaning you don't care what's true anymore you just have to leave yeah with this the uh the unpleasant feeling the suffering yeah and this sort of goes back to um the conversation we're having about like well does miscavige really believe and I said I could make an argument for the fact that he doesn't right because I go it wouldn't be that hard to change the way Scientology treats people just a little bit and you'd probably stop losing anyone because scientologists already believed to such a strong degree you have to be pretty freaking horrible to people to make them leave and that's where you go well does miscavich even want Scientology to expand because if he was really being clever about it it seems like he could at least stop the bleeding and yet he doesn't so that's where you make the argument well if he doesn't then he must not want to so his mind is corrupted to the point where he's not able to actually be a good businessman essentially it seems that way the numbers of scientologists have been going down and down and down since the early 90s is there a good I mean it's very difficult to get to this number but is there a good estimate of what the current number of scientologists are practicing scientologists is oh yeah I did a video about this it's actually quite easy to get to the number it's not more than 35 000 in the entire world and that's being very generous and charitable that's I was intentionally generous I broke it all down in a spreadsheet and everything you know what can you give like some insights of how you get that information sure there's about 175 to 200 Scientology organizations in the world anybody who's ever worked at these organizations know there's not more than 35 to 50 staff members per org there's not more than one to two hundred public scientologists per org I broke down the number of CR members who'd be working at every Continental Management unit middle Management International Management I broke it on the mission network and I was generous I mean my numbers were like if L Ron Hubbard came back and they were doing an event L Ron Hubbard was coming back and announcing ot9 and 10 how many scientologists could we scrape together in every city to come to this event it wasn't more than 35 000. now contrast that to what Scientology says Millions 10 million people is this less people than there used to be yeah at its peak it was about a hundred thousand active members but never the millions ever no has uh David miscavige used the violence as there in your understanding of it in your estimation sort of uh harassment assault and actual I don't know how to define assault but violence oh yeah dozens of former CR members from the international base have told stories of being assaulted by miscavige in fact Mike rinder is probably the one person who's been assaulted by miscavige more than anyone else he's personally probably haven't assaulted dozens of times who's my Kinder so man here one of the highest ranking Executives in Scientology he was author there you go a billion years oh a billion years it's a it really is a fantastic book because Lex the guy the guy was born and raised in Scientology and worked personally with El Ron Hubbard and worked personally with David miscavige for decades like it doesn't get much more Insider than that a candid and deeply felt Memoir of a life lost to false belief and courageously regained Lawrence Wright a billion years my escape from a life in the highest ranks of Scientology my grinder it's a fantastic book um he also narrates his own audiobook too I know you like the audiobooks that's how I listen to it yeah so Mike famously you know I just said a moment ago like someone who's treated so horribly even though he still believed in Scientology that he had no choice but to leave and he tells he tells the story in that book and he still believes in Scientology for years after he escaped for years because there's this thing called The Independent Scientology movement or the free zone or whatever there are people who do Scientology outside of the Church of Scientology there's just not many of them but Mike was one of those people who was actually doing Scientology even after he left now he no longer believes in that anymore and he doesn't do it but but even though he still believed even though everything he knew was what he was leaving behind he still had to leave it behind and by the way I just throw open to random page and he says when I signed on for sea organ Adelaide in 1973 the recruiter promised I would train as a Scientology executive under the direct tutelage of Hubbard on the Apollo so this is another thing I should probably ask you about there's oh we can go for days I was also told that after I learned all I needed to learn at the foot of the master I would return to Australia to help expand Scientology in my home country so what was the thing that really broke him the final thing is when uh he got to a point where he was no longer being forced to lie to protect elrond Hubbard he was now being forced to lie to protect David miscavige and specifically it was about the allegations of having been assaulted by miscavige Mike rinder was at some um event it might have been a grand opening for a building a Scientology building in London and I believe it was John Sweeney at that time a BBC journalist who you know stuck a camera in a microphone in Mike's face is it true David miscavige assaulted is it true and Mike denied it on camera and then turned around and to himself is like this is what my life has been reduced to lying to protect David miscavage this used to be about elrond Hubbard this used to be about scientology yeah now it's about protecting this douchebag and miscavige had just issued orders that was going to send Mike off to Australia Muscat like miscavige is sadistic that is that is without question sadistic meaning he enjoys inflating pain upon others so he very specifically was going to tell Mike tell render or tell that cocksucker we're shipping him off to Australia he's never going to see his wife and his kids again essentially and that's when Mike was like they were the only reason I hadn't already left so if I follow the orders I'm going to lose them if I leave Scientology I'm going to lose them at least if I leave Scientology I'll be free of something it's fucking sad and he still believed Scientology to some degree after he left is what you're saying yeah has he spoken about what it took to let go of believing in Scientology yeah he does a very good job talking about all of this in the book it took him it took him like four or five years to get that book done like it's a it's a polished version It's a polished version of a story and and I think Mike's about getting ready to start his own YouTube channel so that'll be a lot of fun actually Mike comes on my Channel all the time yeah you guys you guys do a thing together right yeah we do Three Amigos with me and Mike rinder and Mark Hadley that's why I gave you Mark's books I thought maybe you would uh know him from our little Three Amigos are Mondays with Mike and Mark videos Mark Hedley blown for good behind the Iron Curtain of Scientology so he escaped from the international base on a motorcycle it's a wild story I won't even try to do it justice but who's a better writer of the two of them you're not going to get me there like I'm trying to be an investigative journalist for once Mike and Mark are both on the board of the aftermath foundation with me yeah so who's better looking no it's one of my justifications for just putting up content every day is every video is just an excuse to in some little white promote the aftermath foundation and and I do that again one to genuinely help people escape and two because I know it drives David miscavige crazy if you look in your own heart is there anger there I don't think it's anger I don't hate I don't hate Scientology I don't hate David miscavige um I don't even hate my experience in Scientology be able to accept the good yeah from your experience yeah absolutely but it's also the only path that I traveled right so I tend no I'm okay a little less so these days but um earlier in life I tended to attribute all my pot all positive characteristics in me to Scientology because in my simplistic way of thinking I was like what else could it possibly be attributed to right that's a very black and white way of saying it's a beautiful way to see uh to see life no matter what happens to you you attribute like you focus on the positive yeah and you feel like sometimes people have traumatic experiences with parents and so on yeah and if you focus on the positive it's a good way to let go right of the trauma associated with it true but like another example would be like I didn't go to school like I I stopped going to school in the seventh grade but people go but you sound so smart and what am I supposed to do I'm supposed to say well it's because of Scientology like how do I answer that question like if it's the only path I traveled how do I answer that question I don't necessarily want to give Scientology credit but what the hell am I supposed to point to sure you know I mean you said there's you kind of enjoy I mean part of it is you're joking and trolling that you enjoy knowing that your YouTube channel drives Dave miscavige crazy I mean what that means you still I mean there is a joy you have there is a joy there's I'm not going to deny that I don't know what to make of that because there's a I suppose there's an intimacy when you're part of a tribe of that kind it's almost like let me try to let me try to frame it I wasn't trying to get kicked out of Scientology I was trying to not get kicked out of Scientology I you know so what happened first first my mom got kicked out for basically talking some smack about David miscavige and then they go to me and they go okay you've got a disconnect from your mom or you're gonna get kicked out and I lied about that I was like okay I'll disconnect but I never did for a couple years I lied my ass off about it eventually they were like this guy's gonna keep lying to us right and they're like yeah like all right you're out something go to my wife so you got to divorce your husband or you're gonna get kicked out and she goes no that's a hell of a statement from her it's gonna get harder for me here so I'm not quite sure how to okay so I'll try to get I'll try to do it you don't seem like a man who's afraid of hard things okay so she's like no so then they go to her parents and they say you've got to disconnect from your daughter and your three granddaughters but you're gonna get kicked out but they have three other kids who are scientologists who have spouses who are scientologists who have grandkids so I feel like up until that point everybody was sort of making a decision for themselves and what would be best for themselves until they get to her parents and then they're like which grandkids are we going to lose okay at the part where they were trying to get me to disconnect from my mom there were hours that I spent talking to them going you know guys there's another way it doesn't have to go this way there's another way that ends well for all of us and that wasn't even considered and I go like they created this monster and that's a fact and that's why I take joy in it when people when people ask me is Scientology a destructive cult I don't even have to get into all the academic discussions of what's a religion and what's a cult and what's the difference I go as long as they destroy families like that they're occult so they cut people off deliberately one by one and it doesn't have to be that way right and why is it that way I mean it started with L Ron Hubbard laying out a policy framework a policy structure that if interpreted and applied in the worst possible way with the worst possible judgment can be abused in that way I would make the argument that if an anti-broker had taken over that Scientology policy does have enough little um caveats baked into it that even the policies about disconnection could be interpreted and implemented in a non-destructive way there is room for judgment and discretion and miscavige has just created the worst possible version of Scientology and that's that's where you sort of get that argument of does he even want scientologies to succeed because he seems to be hell-bent on making sure that he doesn't yeah and and I don't want to see him make it succeed but it does bring that question up of like what are his motivations can he not see that he's destroying the thing he's supposed to be expanding that's also you know there's ways to measure cost and that would probably be the most costly aspect of Scientology is the suffering associated with the separating of families yeah I mean that's actually just puts make it's a very concrete what we value in human life is the connection to our loved ones like everything else doesn't matter like getting 50 bucks a week uh like that like uh getting money stolen from you getting the truth stolen from you none of that compares uh you can even frame that as the good there could be a lot of positives whatever in the tribe but separating families separating loved ones that's the destructive thing so no hate though no I genuinely don't hate them do you forgive them 100 there's no one I look at in Scientology that I go how dare you if I was in their shoes having to you know operate under David miscavigest orders I would have done the same thing and I would have loved it truthfully I don't blame any of them I mean I take the opposite approach if they knew what I knew they'd be doing what I'm doing yeah if they knew what I knew and believed it they'd be doing what I'm doing they're not dumb it's not it's not it's not dumb people in Scientology they're ambitious they're dreamers they got hope they're driven all that kind of stuff yeah and it's one of the reasons I like putting up content on my channel so they can see hey like if you're a Scientologist you look at that and you go hey he seems like he's doing well he's kind of he's happy he's a positive guy he's a good communicator he knows what he's talking about he's not lying he's not exaggerating I don't exaggerate anything on my channel I don't make up anything and this is actually comes from an experience I had from 1998 to 2000 I was living in La I started at a two-year period in my life where I actually had almost no contact with Scientology and during that time I found my way onto the internet and there was a website it might have been esmb ex-scientology message but whatever it was it was at that time the main source of critical information about scientology on the internet and I looked at it I remember I was still a True Believer and I looked at this and it was so uh offensive um insulting uh hyperbolic exaggerated I was like oh just a bunch of bullshit I was in Scientology for 16 more years if what I had seen on the internet about critical of Scientology if what I had seen when I had seen it was something that actually resonated with me that I was like oh that I believed was true that's incredible I would have gotten out of Scientology 16 years earlier so I was like how can I help create an experience on the internet that if a Scientologist stumbles upon it it will resonate with them instead of repelling them and that is exactly what I have set out to do and what I believe I've accomplished there's the content the message but also just showing that you can be happy outside of Scientology exactly you can have a fulfilling life you can be a good man yeah all that what benefit do you think Tom Cruise gets from Scientology so why is he still in Scientology he genuinely loves it and also miscavige does there's one celebrity who does have the most unique experience in Scientology and that is Tom Scientology hires all of Tom's staff there are no all of Tom's staff are subject to interrogations by Scientology not only in the hiring process but during the employment like David miscavich and Scientology runs Tom Cruise's life and his production company and his household staff do you imagine there's some personal connection there where there's just they like each other a lot best friends I mean it's them against the world yeah is how they see it I think it's pretty easy to see how that works but between the two of them I think this idea of them against the world us against the world is a really power powerful intimate like I kind of see like friendships and relationships that way that I'm not in a dark sense but it's like the world is full of Cruelty and absurdity and unfairness and so on it's nice to huddle together like the Penguins in March of the book against the cold 100 they're just like and so especially with the ideology of uh of of Scientology it uh this idea that you can you can be anything you can essentially I mean you you can manifest it essentially through like believing it um I mean you don't really put into those words but believing that you're you're a God this is a really like inspiring positive thing to think if they could figure out how to do all that without destroying families and bankrupting its members they might actually have a future that's why like it's funny because sometimes I feel like it's like like I'm rooting for them to like succeed and do it right and I'm not but it's an interesting academic discussion to have of like we can all see how much people will sacrifice in the names of belief and religion yeah we can see how much scientologists sacrifice based on what they already believe if you would just start treating people less horribly you know what I'm saying it might actually have a future but that's what I wanted to it seems like this dark lesson of human nature that they like there's something about you know to use the word Cults that you just stop seeing reality for what it is there's a lot of things that could make this a better organization that's actually helping people flourish and um and and be a little bit more like uh loose about membership right not dividing families not causing suffering not causing Financial harm but actually inspiring people and helping people but then maybe and it fundamentally changes of what the organization is and maybe that means somebody like David miscavige loses power too which might be very difficult or people that are close to him lose power and people hold on to power so yeah whatever the human forces here it seems to become worse and worse over time what about uh oh let me ask a conspiracy question is there a chance that Tom Cruise is being blackmailed that there's information from auditing no no so that kind of stuff is not that's very good I've actually come out and said definitively uh I do not know of a single person who stays in Scientology because they're afraid of being blackmailed it's just not a thing it's just not a thing does Scientology have enough information to Black still blackmail someone if they wanted to well sure I mean and it doesn't have to be true it could just be lies who cares who knows Scientology can say whatever the hell they want so that's the thing it doesn't even have to be true and actually that would be the argument against blackmailing like in order for Scientology to Blackmail you with that information they'd actually have to represent that yes he really did tell us this and it's like well wasn't why are you spilling secrets of members right like it sets a bad precedent what are some of the sins according to Scientology most of the sins from a Scientology perspective are just doing or saying anything that being brings um disrepute to Scientology itself right um remember they don't it's not like Christianity where there's rules if you break this rule you're not getting into heaven yeah because scientologists and think about things oh well there's the drug you can't do drugs right you can't do uh drugs uh and you can't take any psychotropic medications and no medications almost at all you're allowed to take medications it's just um there's no rules expressly uh prohibiting it it's just most scientologists tend not to you can take Advil but many scientologists won't okay um you just can't take anything prescribed by a psychiatrist a psychologist or any drugs that are psychotropic drugs I mean ssris are considered probably the closest thing to Pure Evil in the world of Scientology what about weird question what about sex is there boundaries on what's there used to not be it's become very puritanical in in the last many decades for a reason I can't actually explain like miscavige does seem to be infatuated with controlling sex like that that is one thing about miscavige version of Scientology that's gotten very strange I mean L Ron Hubbard even specifically wrote a policy that says we are no longer going to regulate in any way the bedroom activities of people he literally said from this point on no one is allowed to be subject to any justice actions of any kind whatsoever for anything they do in their sexual lives uh but that was still did not give permission for gay relationships that was still referring to straight stuff and uh monogamous only can you do promise that can you open marriages and open relationships according to that over on Hubbard policy you can yeah but you know I think he wrote that policy before he created the C organization and then what happened is this is actually how this came into effect uh he created this organization you had a lot of people on a ship and everybody was just banging each other and it created just a nightmare of personal relationship that it was making production impossible not because everybody was spending so much time banging but because everybody was so upset about who was begging him yeah I mean sex and sex and that kind of dynamic is really um I mean human humans do what humans do and then there's drama and all that it's it's understandable because everybody's so intimate it's the closed tribe uh it makes sense to limit sex otherwise everyone's but otherwise it becomes a sex cult yeah which a lot of them end up becoming well on that topic would you classify Scientology as a cult 100 but not because I'm like fully conversant with the academic uh differentiations between what's a religion and what's a cult I mean Scientology would say well all small new religions are Cults and I don't know that's probably true some people would say all religions are called so maybe like depends on how you Define religion and it depends on how you Define cult but I just fall back on my thing of like if you're destroying families yeah and bankrupting your members you're a cult that's us versus them and the them could be your family it could be your loved ones that uh that's deeply destructive and one of the things you would probably throw into a definition of a call to something that's actually destructive because like I do a lot of stuff that they're caught like like Jiu Jitsu like there's a lot of really close-knit tribes but there's no negative toxicity to it there's no uh divide there's no divisions or if there is it's more boy try being a fan of a certain soccer team and then becoming a fan of another soccer that's hardcore and like but I'll tell you I trained Jiu Jitsu as well and I have found that community of people to be one of the most loving and uh helpful uh group of people ever shout out to John Keller Gracie Baja Clearwater um no but seriously like it's one of it's one of the reasons I continue to do it despite my back my hip my shoulder it's like it's just such a cool group of guys goes on uh you used to not I think it was much more divisive uh in the beginning uh from this Brazilian Roots one of the things that's really hard is the team oriented like if you're this team you're you're right or die with this team and there's no there's a crunches they go to another team yeah and I think that aspect that was actually a turn off for me in the beginning that the toxicity of that because I understand that a little bit for the elites for the highest of the highest that there's I like the Brotherhood and the Loyalty of the people like the Olympic gold medalists the like the best in the world yes but for like recreational fun like it's like this is all ultimately about the camaraderie of all human beings together not some whatever label you put on your on yourself I don't think we actually talked about the organization itself we talked about uh tax exempt status which is really important we talked about some of the control like through the propaganda control of what's out there it's actually interesting that you said that like the Scientology has pretty much lost the battle with the internet oh yeah um which is kind of inspiring that it's hard to defeat the internet but then there's like Bots there I think if you're sophisticated I'm not sure that's true but if you're not it's kind of remarkable they haven't been able to capitalize on these bot armies because there's one thing that they have it's a lot of tax-free money that they got nothing else better to do it yeah right so you can invest you know they just they should give you a call like they just don't have the right people apparently uh but that said how do they wield uh influence with government agencies with you've talked about the the local police yeah uh enforcement uh also federal agencies anything that is the one way they effectively put their money to use is lobbyists and attorneys um you know judges very rarely have they ever been able just to get a politician on their side it's the behind the scenes people you know Greta Van susteren's a very high level long-term Scientologist and her husband I always get it wrong it's either Jim Cole or John Cole I always get it wrong uh he's a very powerful attorney who has a lot uh wields a lot of influence behind the scenes and that's just one example like the reason why that's an interesting example is because he's actually a Scientologist and he travels in those circles Scientology though it's money goes to good use by hiring non-scientologists retired judges attorneys lobbyists it really is how they get almost anything done like miscavige himself is not hobnob and glad hand and shaking hands and meeting these folks it's the non-scientologist professionals who work behind the scenes on scientology's behalf can you describe the Dynamics of that how that actually happens like like why why would the why would the police department work on behalf of Scientology I meant more the courts and Regulators not the police department but well for example it can come down to something as simple as this sign in Clearwater Scientology hires Clearwater Police to do off-duty work for them they pay like three times the normal off-duty rate so they will even though I'm not aware of anyone on the Clearwater PD who's actually a Scientologist they basically end up with they would call them allies or safe points right people who like will literally operate a Scientology spies you know if someone comes in and follows a report about some child sex case someone in the Clearwater PD is calling Sarah Heller at the office of special Affairs at the Flying Latin base to let her know hey heads up we got a thing coming in and then Scientology can run around and go talk to all the scientologists who have knowledge about this and either get them out of clear water you know so it's not like uh direct explicit corruption but more just uh friends and co-workers yeah integrated deeply in in the in the community yeah I call it soft corruption so on another example you have um the mayor of Clearwater Frank Hibbard um well he used to when when he won his recent election he stepped down from some of these nonprofits that he served on but the non-profits that he served on also gets millions of dollars of donations from some of scientology's richest Clearwater members right you have one of the mayor's best friends Joe Burdette literally a paid lobbyist for Scientology so that creates a chilling effect on anyone who's going to be talking smack about scientology because his friends are on their damn payroll so um I call it soft corruption it's not illegal it's not illegal um but it's how Scientology wields influence and what's what's ironic is that a lot of these people who work on Scientology behalf actually secretly hate Scientology they kind of see through it but as part of the community I mean it's deeply integrated in the community and there's financial leverage um are you ever afraid I mean afraid for your well-being afraid for your ability to function in society because of the pressures from Scientology no is that because you're genetically malfunctioning or or mentally or or is it or is there speaking out as a kind of protection I think it's one of those things that once you've seen behind the curtain and you see The Wizard of Oz is just a silly man you just don't have any fear now it's one of these things like people say oh you're so brave and I go huh what's that quote bravery is you know being a soldier and being afraid and going in any way it's not rapes running if you don't think nothing's gonna happen to you like so I'm just trying to like I do not hold myself up as an example of Bravery because yeah I it's not like oh they could destroy me but I don't care no there's not a damn thing they can do to me and it's one of that's one of the reasons I continue to put out content every day to just basically go hey still here I dare you to try to do something about it but you can't and hope that that also serves as kind of an example for other people to go if this Schmo can do it yeah and they can't do anything else to him then maybe I can do it too because I would love it I would love there for be a 20 channels where former scientologists talk about their experience I mean that is bravery because what happens is fear seeps in even if it's not grounded in reality but at the same time like uh you know um my grandfather who uh fought in in World War II I mean the story is I mean he was very convinced and sure most of the people he fought alongside with died he was a machine gunner but he believed that bullets can't hit him right that's what he said well you know sir he was right right because he survived so there's some sense like you're never biased that he's like just like yours like I'm not brave I just the boys can't hit me I mean there's a dark kind of Truth to that there's some you know it's like uh it's it's a feedback loop where if you have the confidence and you push on forward and you're brave in that way to not let fear see pen and affect you it actually gives you less things to be scared about and yeah I mean but that initial few steps might be uh for people it might be a very difficult stuff to take to talk about publicly the fear was knowing how the family was going to be destroyed and trying to prevent that I was terrified of that happening but it happened there's nothing left to be afraid of and that's kind of the thing like they created this Beast and the same is true for Mark Headley the same is true from Mike render I I said they've essentially created a Scientology proof virus Scientology resistant strain by throwing everything they have at us for so many years they have just through natural selection created people who just do not give a damn about anything they could or would do and maybe there is something a little wrong with me because when I get a phone call from someone like I just got this phone call about you and it's clear that it's Scientology pis doing work behind the scenes I get really excited I get really excited I don't get nervous I'm like oh no it's happening like oh yeah this is going to be exciting I'm like okay because everything they try to do to me I'm gonna figure out how to reflect it back on them and make them look ridiculous and that pales in comparison to the separating from family exactly what is there is there parts of your family that you've lost because of Scientology just yes if you most of my episode on the Lee Remedy in the aftermath show was talking about me and my twin brother it's just a pretty horrible story it's just a pretty horrible story so I do have a younger brother who's still in Scientology and disconnected from me but I never had much of a relationship um with that brother um really to begin with right um but my twin brother died when I was like 23 or 24. and that was without any question a direct result of um our Scientology experience you know he died in a car accident that wasn't technically his fault or anything like he wasn't even the one driving but uh the fact the the specific fact of his death was not meaning like the the fact and the manner of his death and wasn't like specifically because of Scientology but our story and how uh where our relationship got to and how he was even in a position of having something like that happen to him is directly attributable to Scientology do you think about him miss him it's part of what you're doing in memory of him yeah for sure man this is I mean you know we were identical twins can you imagine two of me barely handle one I love it losing him would that be the darkest moment in this whole journey of Scientology for you two moments would equal the darkest moment it it would be that and also just the period of you know six nine twelve months of impending doom knowing that my wife's whole family was gonna be obliterated and that there's nothing we could do about it and uh and kind of telling ourselves every step of the way it wasn't really going to happen you know um and I really felt like you ever watch the Ozarks I felt like Marty bird now this was happening before the Ozarks but when I watched the Ozarks and I see that character the entire world is crumbling down around him and all he can oh I did my all right what's the next step I watch Marty bird and I go that's my fucking spirit animal because you can only control what you can control and um you can't keep Scientology from destroying your family and and literally like I it's funny I mentioned the show a lot because I watched that and I go like that's exactly how I felt you know I talk about this six months or nine or 12 months whatever it was of impending doom it's not like I was an emotional wreck during that time you know in private I was but it's not like I was just freaking out it was like the sun's gonna come up tomorrow the World's Gonna keep spinning I can't control it this is hard I can't believe this is happening but tomorrow's a new day um I've never personally even at the darkest times I've never experienced anything that I would characterize as depression certainly not ever any suicidal thoughts or anything even in the darkest of times I and again this one thing I go is it because of Scientology or is it just me there really is an emotional detachment there almost has to be and it's a cold calculation what what are my options what do I do here and then once I figure out the answer to that question I'm actually quite chipper and happy you know like that's sort of my default like you could give me six horrible options once I figure out the best of those six I'm gonna feel like I just had a pretty good day that's brilliant because I just watching Ozarks is so stressful it is right it's so stressful watching it is it and uh he usually finds a way and usually it is a set of really bad options and it's one of the bad options what's the best of the bad options and he almost gets pissed off at everyone around him for being so pouty about it but you know what's that show again the same way again oh but you know it's like you know it's still simmering there right under the surface it's like pretty damn close to the surface do you know what I mean yeah yeah and um people sometimes ask about recovery and whatnot and like what does that look like and what does that mean and it sort of goes back to kind of the emotional Detachment is I go what the fuck does recovery even mean if you're an alcoholic and you're recovering you know what that means I used to drink I don't drink now well I used to be an occult and I'm not an occult now how else am I supposed to feel about this for someone to be like it seems like you've recovered what the fuck does that even mean like I'm sure some academic has an answer to that question I'm not someone who particular I don't spend any time thinking about that my recovery is success and a little bit of trolling and revenge yeah but mostly success you know what does it mean to be a recovered former cult member what you don't cry when people ask you about your brother I don't know what it means um I've never had therapy but not because I'm still like against it from Scientology I just like I'm not gonna pay to talk to someone do you know where else I could do that Scientology now I know there's a lot of people going like oh boy I know it's a lot I'm not shitting on therapy I would rather have a beer with my friend and talk about this shit yeah than talk to a professional for 200 an hour as a kind of therapy yeah yeah yeah listen that's the important part of the reason I do this podcast is talking to people that you care about the that you're close with this is a really powerful powerful thing but yeah I don't know what recovery looks like and success to you is defined just be find happiness find happiness outside the closed bubble that defines What happiness looks like a Scientology if I can make my kids happy that's success to me what advice would you give to your kids on how to live travel the world a life they can be proud of travel the world travel the world um get rid of friends who don't push you up and tear and don't celebrate your success it's it's hard to give that advice to young children because kids are always so catty but honestly it's like when I see that that really is I just think not just advice to my kids but some of the best advice to anybody yeah if you've got anyone around you who doesn't celebrate your success just spend less time with those people surround yourself with people who actually want to celebrate your success and push you to succeed I think that's true I think it's even more important at a young age because if if at a young age you get used to being around people who kind of take joy and tearing you down then that's what you become accustomed to yeah you know and I just think you know having friends who love you and support you is just about closest thing to the true meaning of life and uh who believe in you who believe in your potential and some of those ideas underlie the good parts of Scientology yeah and uh except there's a lot of dark parts of Scientology that separate you from the people that believe in you and that love you well this is a beautiful conversation you're a beautiful human being who uh came full of gifts and I I mean I I genuinely uh first of all you're an aspiring human being but most
