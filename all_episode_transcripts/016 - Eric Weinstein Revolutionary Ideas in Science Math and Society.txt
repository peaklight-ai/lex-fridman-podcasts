the following is a conversation with Eric Weinstein he's a mathematician economist physicist and a managing director of teal Capital he coined the term and you could say is the founder of the intellectual dark web which is a loosely assemble group of public intellectuals that includes Sam Harris Jordan Peterson Steven Pinker Joe Rogan Michael Shermer and a few others this conversation is part of the artificial intelligence podcast at MIT and beyond if you enjoy it subscribe on youtube itunes or simply connect with me on twitter at Lex Friedman spelled Fri D and now here's my conversation with Eric Weinstein are you nervous about this specialist okay the bus policia you mentioned Kung Fu Panda is one of your favorite movies it has the usual profile master student dynamic going on so who was who has been a teacher that significantly influenced the direction of your thinking and life's work so if you're the Kung Fu Panda who was your Shifu oh well it's interesting because I didn't see Shifu as being the teacher who was the teacher who way Master Oogway the turtle oh the turtle right they only meet twice in the entire film and the first conversation sort of doesn't count so the magic of the film in fact it's point yeah is that the teaching that really matters is transferred during a single conversation and it's very brief and so who played that role in my life I would say either my grandfather Harry Rubin and his wife Sophie Rubin my grandmother or Tom Lehrer Tom Lehrer yeah in which way if you give a child Tom Lehrer records what you do is you destroy their ability to be taken over by later malware and it's so irreverent so witty so clever so obscene that it destroys the ability to lead a normal life for many people so if I meet somebody who is usually really shifted from any kind of neurotypical presentation I'll often ask them are you a Tom Lehrer fan and the odds that they will respond are quite high Tom layer is poisoning pigeons in the park Tom layer that's very interesting there's small number of Tom Lehrer songs that broke into the general population poisoning pigeons in the park the element song and perhaps the Vatican rag so when you meet somebody who knows those songs but doesn't know are you judging me right now aren't you harshly no but you're Russian so I dad as the you known Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky that's us yeah yeah that was a song about plagiarism that was in fact plagiarized which most people don't know from Danny Kaye where Danny Kaye did a song called Stanislavski of the musky arts and so Tom Lehrer did this brilliant job of plagiarizing a song about and making it about plagiarism and then making it about this mathematician who worked in non Euclidean geometry that was like giving heroin to a child it was extremely addictive and eventually led me to a lot of different places one of which may have been a PhD in mathematics and he was also at least a lecturer in mathematics I believe at Harvard something like that I just had dinner with him in fact when my son turned 13 we didn't tell him but his Bar Mitzvah present was dinner with his hero Tom Lehrer and Tom Lehrer was 88 years old sharp as a tack irreverent and funny as hell and just you know there very few people in this world that you have to meet while they're still here and that was definitely one for our family so that wit is a reflection of intelligence in some kind of deep way like where that would be a good test of intelligence whether you're Tom Lehrer fan so what do you think that is about wit about that kind of humor ability to see the absurdity in existence well do you think that's connected to intelligence or we just two Jews on a mic that appreciate that kind of humor no I think that it's up connected to intelligence so you can see it there's a place where Tom Lehrer decides that he's going to Lampoon Gilbert of Gilbert &amp; Sullivan and he's going to outdo Gilbert with clever meaningless wordplay and he has forget the policy he's doing Clementine as if Gilbert and Sullivan wrote and he says that I missed her depressed her young sister named mr. this mr. de pester she tried pestering sisters a festering blister you best her resistor say aye the sister persisted the mister resisted I kissed her all loyalty slipped when he said when she said I could have her her sister's cadaver must surely have turned in its crypt that's so dense it's so insane yeah that that's clearly intelligence because it's hard to construct something like that if I look at my favorite Tom Lehrer Tom Lehrer lyric you know there's a perfectly absurd one which is once all the Germans were warlike and mean but that couldn't happen again we taught them a lesson in 1918 and they've hardly bothered us since then right that is a different kind of intelligence you know you're taking something that is so horrific and you're you're sort of making it palatable and funny and demonstrating also just your humanity I mean I think the thing that came through as as Tom Lehrer wrote all of these terrible horrible lines was just what a sensitive and beautiful soul he was who was channeling pain through humor and through grace I've seen throughout Europe throughout Russia that same kind of humor emerge from the generation of world war two it seemed like that humor is required to somehow deal with the pain and the suffering of that that war created well you do need the environment to create the broad Slavic soul I don't think that many Americans really appreciate Russian humor how you had to joke during the time of let's say article 58 under Stalin you had to be very very careful you know that the concept of a Russian satirical magazine like crocodile doesn't make sense so you have this cross-cultural problem that there are certain areas of human experience that it would be better to know nothing about and quite unfortunately Eastern Europe knows a great deal about them which makes the you know the songs of Vladimir Vysotsky so potent the you know the prose of Pushkin whatever it is you have to appreciate the depth of the Eastern European experience and I would think that perhaps Americans knew something like this around the time of the Civil War or maybe you know under slavery and Jim Crow or even the harsh tyranny of the coal and steel employers during the labor Wars but in general I would say it's hard for us to understand and imagine the collective culture unless we have the system of selective pressures that for example Russians were subjected to yeah so if there's one good thing that comes out of war its literature art and humor music oh I don't think so I think almost everything is good about war except for death and destruction right without the death they would bring and the romance of it the whole thing is nice well this is why we're always caught up in war we have this very ambiguous relationship to it is that it makes life real and pressing and meaningful and at an unacceptable price and the price has never been higher so just jump in a into AI a little bit you are in one of the conversation you had or one of the videos you described that one of the things AI systems can't do and biological systems can itself replicate in the physical world oh no in the physical world well yeah the physical robots can self-replicate but but you this is a very tricky point which is that the only thing that we've been able to create that's really complex that has an analog of our reproductive system is software but nevertheless software replicates itself if we're speaking strictly for the replication in this kind of digital space so I mean just to begin and you ask a question do you see a protective barrier or a gap between the physical world and the digital world let's not call it digital let's call it the logical world versus the physical world why illogical well because even though we had let's say Einstein's brain preserved it was meaningless to us as a physical object because we couldn't do anything with what was stored in it at a logical level and so the idea that something may be stored logically and that it may be stored physically are not necessarily we don't always benefit from synonymous I'm not suggesting that there isn't a material basis to the logical world but that it does warrant identification with a separate layer that need not invoke logic gates and zeros and ones and so connecting those two worlds the logical world in the physical world or maybe just connecting to the logical world inside our brains is brain you mentioned the idea of out out telogen s-- artificial app telogen artificial intelligence yes this is the only essay that Jon Brockman ever invited me to write that he refused to publish an edge why well maybe it wasn't it wasn't well written but I don't know the idea is quite compelling is quite unique and new and at least from my view a stance point maybe you can explain it sure what I was thinking about is why it is that we're waiting to be terrified by artificial general intelligence when in fact artificial life is terrifying in and of itself and it's already here so in order to have a system of selective pressures you need three distinct elements you need variation within a population you need heritability and you need differential success so what's really unique and I've made this point I think elsewhere about software is that if you think about what humans know how to build that's impressive so I always take a car and I say does it have an analogue of each of the physical physiological systems does it have a skeletal structure that's its frame does it have a neurological structure has an on-board computer as a digestive system the one thing it doesn't have is a reproductive system but if you can call spawn on a process effectively you do have a reproductive system and that means that you can create something with variation heritability and differential success now the next step in the chain of thinking was where do we see inanimate non intelligent life outwitting intelligent life and I have two favorite systems I try to stay on them so that we don't get distracted one of which is the Oh freeze orchid subspecies or subclade I don't know what to call it a type of flower yeah it's a type of flower that mimics the female of a pollinator species in order to dupe the males into engaging it was called pseudo copulation with the fake female which is usually represented by the lowest petal and there's also a pheromone component to fool the males into thinking they have a mating opportunity but the flower doesn't have to give up energy energy in the form of nectar as a lure because it's tricking the males the other system is a particular species of muscle lamp bacillus in the clear streams of Missouri and it fools bass into biting a fleshy lip that contain its young and when the bass see this fleshy lip which looks exactly like a species of fish that the baths like to eat the the young explode and clamp on to the gills and parasitize the bass and also lose the bass to redistribute them as they eventually release both of these systems you have a highly intelligent dupe being fooled by a lower life-form and what is sculpting these convincing lures it's the intelligence of previously duped targets for these strategies so when the target is smart enough to avoid the strategy those weaker mimics fall off they have terminal lines and only the better ones survive so it's an arms race between the target species that is being parasitized getting smarter and this other less intelligent or non intelligent object getting as if smarter and so what you see is is that artificial intelligence artificial general intelligence is not needed to parasitize us it's simply sufficient for us to outwit ourselves so you could have a program let's say you know one of these Nigerian scams that writes letters and uses whoever sends it Bitcoin to figure out which aspects of the program should be kept which should be varied and thrown away and you don't need it to be in any way intelligent in order to have a really nightmarish scenario being parasitized by something that has no idea what it's doing so you you you phrase a few cots have really eloquently so let me try to uh as a few directions this goes so one first on the way we write software today it's not common that we allow it to self modify hope we do have that ability now we have the ability it's just not common it's not just common so so your your thought is that that is a serious worry if there becomes it's all Spotify encode is available now so there are different types of self modification right there's a personalization you know your email app your gmail is self-modifying to you after you log in or whatever you can think of it that way but ultimately it's central all the information is centralized but you're thinking of ideas where you're completely so this is an unique entity operating under selective pressures and it changes well you just if you think about the fact that our immune systems don't know what's coming at them next but they have a small set of spanning components and if it's if it's a sufficiently expressive system in that any shape or binding region can be approximated with with the Lego that is present then you can have confidence that you don't need to know what's coming at you because the combinatorics are sufficient to reach any configuration needed so that's a beautiful thing well terrifying thing to worry about because it's so within our reach whatever I suggest these things I do always have a concern as to whether or not I will bring them into being by talking about them so uh there's this thing from open e I said next next week to talk to the founder of open AI this idea that their text generation the new the new stuff they have for generating text is they didn't want to bring it they didn't want to release it because they're worried about the I'm kind of lighted to hear that but they're going to end up really yes so that's the thing is I think talking about it I'm well at least from my end I'm more a proponent of technology preventing techni so further innovation preventing the detrimental effects of innovation well we're a we're sort of tumbling down a hill at accelerating speed so whether or not we're proponents or it doesn't mean it may not matter but I do not well I do feel that there are people who have held things back and you know died poorer than they might have otherwise been and we don't even know their names I don't think that we should discount the idea that having the smartest people showing off how smart they are by what they've developed maybe a terminal process I'm very mindful in particular of a beautiful letter that Edward Teller of all people wrote to Leo Szilard where Ziller was trying to free how to control the use of atomic weaponry at the end of World War two and tell her rather strangely because many of us view him as a monster showed some a very advanced moral thinking talking about the slim chance we have for survival and that the only hope is to make Warren thinkable I do think that not enough of us feel in our gut what it is we are playing with when we are working on technical problems and I would recommend to anyone who hasn't seen it a movie called the bridge over the bridge on the river kwai about I believe captured British POWs who just in a desire to do a bridge well end up over collaborating with their Japanese captors well now you're making me question the unrestricted open discussion of ideas and AI I'm not saying I know the answer I'm just saying that I could make a decent case for either our need to talk about this and to become technologically focused on containing it or need to stop talking about this and try to hope that the relatively small number of highly adept individuals who are looking at these problems is small enough that we should in fact be talking about how to contain them well the way ideas the way innovation happens what new ideas develop Newton with calculus whether if he was silent the idea would be would emerge elsewhere well in the case of Newton of course but you know it was in case of AI how small is the set of individuals out of which such ideas would arise well the idea is that the researchers we know and those that we don't know who may live in countries that don't wish us to know what what level they're currently at are very disciplined and keeping these things to themselves out of course I will point out that there's a religious school in Kerala that developed something very close to the calculus certainly in terms of infinite series in in I guess religious prayer and and in Ryman prose so you know it's not that Newton had any ability to hold that back and I don't really believe that we have an ability to hold it back I do think that we could change the proportion of the time we spend worrying about the effects what if we are successful rather than simply trying to succeed note that we'll be able to contain things later beautifully put so on the idea of all telogen s-- what form treading cautiously is we've agreed as we tumbled down the hill what can top ourselves can we can we cannot well form do you do you see it taking so one example Facebook Google what do want to I don't know a better word you want to influence users to behave a certain way and so that's one kind of example of all telogen s-- is systems perhaps modifying the behavior of their these intelligent human beings in order to sell more product of different kind but do you see other examples of this actually emerging in just take any parasitic system you know make sure that there's some way in which that there's differential success heritability and in variation and those are the magic ingredients and if you really wanted to build a nightmare machine make sure that the system that expresses the variability has a spanning set so that it can learn to arbitrary levels by making it sufficiently expressive that's your nightmare so it's your nightmare but it could also be as it's a really powerful mechanism by which to create well powerful systems so are you more worried about the the negative direction that might go versus the positive so you said parasitic but that doesn't necessarily need to be what the system converges towards it could be what is it not hirsutism the dividing line between parasitism and symbiosis is not so clear that's what they tell me about marriage I'm still so I know well yeah I did we could go into that too but no I think we have to appreciate you know are you infected by your own mitochondria right right yeah so you know in marriage you fear the loss of Independence but even though the American therapeutic community may be very concerned about codependence what's to say the codependence isn't what's necessary to have a stable relationship in which to raise children who are maximally k-selected and require incredible amounts of care because you have to wait 13 years before there's any reproductive payout and most of us don't want our 13 year olds having kids as a very tricky situation to analyze and I would say that predators and parasites Drive much of our evolution and I don't know whether to be angry at them or thank them well ultimately they I mean nobody knows the meaning of life or what even happiness is but there is some metrics did you tell you again they didn't that's why all the poetry books are about they you know there's some metrics under which you can kind of measure how good it is that these ACI systems are roaming about so your mores you're more nervous about software than you are optimistic about ideas of yeah self-replicating Lars I don't think we've really felt where we are you know occasionally get a wake-up 9/11 was so anomalous compared to everything we've out everything else we've experienced on American soil that it came to us as a complete shock that that was even a possibility what it really was was a highly creative and determined R&amp;D team deep in the bowels of Afghanistan showing us that we had certain exploits that we were open to that nobody had chosen to express I can think of several of these things that I don't talk about publicly that just seemed to have to do with how relatively unimaginative those who wish to cause havoc and destruction have been up until now the great mystery of our time of this particular little era is how remarkably stable we've been since 1945 when we demonstrated the ability to use nuclear weapons and anger and we don't know why things like that haven't happened since then we've had several close calls we had mistakes we've had brinksmanship and what's now happened is that we've settled into a sense that oh it's it'll always be nothing it's been so long since something was at that level of danger that we've got a wrong idea in our head and that's why when I went on the Ben Shapiro show I talked about the need to resume above-ground testing of nuclear devices because we have people whose developmental experience suggests that when let's say Donald Trump and North Korea engage on Twitter oh it's nothing it's just posturing everybody's just in it for money there's that there's an a sense that people are in a video game mode which has been the right call since 1945 we've been mostly in video game mode it's amazing so you're worried about a generation which has not seen any existential but we've lived under it see you're younger I don't know if any again you came from from Moscow there was a TV show called the day after it had a huge effect on a generation and growing up in the US and he talked about what life would be like after a nuclear exchange we have not gone through an embodied experience collectively where we've thought about this and I think it's one of the most irresponsible things that the elders among us have done which is to provide this beautiful garden in which the thorns are cut off of the of the rose bushes and all of the edges are rounded and sanded and so people have developed this totally unreal idea which is everything's going to be just fine and do I think that my leading concern is AGI or my leading concern is thermonuclear exchange or gene drives or any one of these things I don't know but I know that our time here in this very long experiment here is finite because the toys that we've built are so impressive and the wisdom to accompany them has not materialized and I think it's we actually got a wisdom uptick since 1945 we had a lot of dangerous skilled players on the world stage nevertheless no matter how bad they were managed to not embroil us in something that we couldn't come back from the Cold War yeah and the distance from the Cold War you know I'm very mindful of there was a Russian tradition actually of on your wedding day going to visit a memorial to those who gave their lives can you imagine this or you your happiest day of your life you go and you pay homage to the people who fought and died in the Battle of Stalingrad I'm not a huge fan of communism I gotta say but there were a couple of things that the Russians did that were really positive in the Soviet era and I think trying to let people know how serious life actually is is the Russian model of seriousness is better than the American model and maybe like you mentioned there was a small echo of that after 9/11 but that we wouldn't let it form we talked about 9/11 but it's 912 that really moved the needle when we were all just there and nobody wanted to speak we suddenly we witness something super serious and we didn't want to run to our computers and blast out our deep thoughts and our feelings and it it was profound because we woke up briefly there you know I talked about the gated institutional narrative and that sort of programs our lives that I've seen it break three times in my life one of which was the election of Donald Trump well another time was the fall of Lehman Brothers when everybody who knew that Bear Stearns wasn't that important knew that Lehman Brothers met AIG was next and the other one was 9/11 and so if I'm 53 years old and I only remember three times that the global narrative was really interrupted that tells you how much we've been on top of developing events you know I mean we had the murrah Federal Building explosion but it didn't cause the narrative to break wasn't profound enough around nine twelve we started to wake up out of our slumber and the powers that be did not want to coming together they you know the the admonition was go shopping and the powers would be was what is that force as opposed to blaming individual we don't know so whatever that whatever that forces there's a sound holdin of it that's emergent and there's a component of it that's deliberate so give yourself a portfolio with two components some amount of it is emergent but some amount of it is also an understanding if people come together they become an incredible force and what you're seeing right now I think is there are forces that are trying to come together and their forces that are trying to push things apart and you know one of them is the globalist narrative versus the national narrative where to the global a globalist perspective the National Bank's in essence that they're temporary they're nationalistic they're jingoistic it's all negative to people in the national more in the national idiom they're saying look this is where I pay my taxes this is where I do my army service this is where I have a vote this is where I have a passport who the hell are you to tell me that because you've moved into some place that you can make money globally that you've chosen to abandon other people to whom you have a special and elevated duty and I think that these competing narratives have been pushing towards the global perspective from the elite and a larger and larger number of disenfranchised people are saying hey I actually live in a in a place and I have laws and I speak a language I have a culture and who are you to tell me that because you can profit in some faraway land that my obligations to my fellow countrymen are so so much diminished so these tensions between nations and so on ultimately you see being proud of your country and so on which creates potentially the kind of things that led to Wars and so on they ultimately it is human nature and it is good for us for wake-up calls of different guys well I think that these are tensions and my point isn't I mean nationalism run amok is a nightmare an internationalism run amok is a nightmare and the problem is we're trying to push these pendulums to someplace where they're somewhat balanced where we we have a higher duty of care to those who share our log our laws and our citizenship but we don't forget our duties of care to the global system I would think this is elementary but the problem that we're facing concerns the ability for some to profit at the abandoned by abandoning their obligations to others within their system and that's what we've had for decades he mentioned nuclear weapons I was hoping to get answers from you since one of the many things you've done as a economics and maybe you can understand human behavior why the heck we haven't blown each other up yet but okay so well good I know the answer yes it's a it's a fast it's it's really important to say that we really don't know and a mild uptick in wisdom a mild uptick in wisdom that's well Steven big pink it wasn't who I've talked with his a lot of really good ideas about why but no I I don't trust his optimism listen I'm Russian so I never trusting I was that optimist no no it's just that you're talking about a guy who's looking at a system in which more and more of the kinetic energy like war has been turned into potential energy like unused nuclear weapon Beata Filipa and you know now I'm looking at that system and I'm saying okay well if you don't have a potential energy term then everything's just getting better and better yeah wow this has beautifully put only in physicists good okay not a physicist is that a dirty word no no I wish I were a physicist me too my dad's a physicist I'm trying to live up that probably for the rest of my life he's probably gonna listen to this too so you did yeah so your friend Sam Harris worries a lot about the existential threat of AI not in the way that you've described but in the more well he hangs out with Elon I don't know so are you worried about that kind of you know about the about either robotic systems or you know traditionally defined AI systems essentially becoming super intelligent much more intelligent in human beings and getting well they already are and they're not when seen as a collective you mean well I mean I can mean all sorts of things but certainly many of the things that we thought were peculiar to general intelligence or do not require general intelligence so that's been one of the big awakenings that you can write a pretty convincing sports story from stats alone without needing to have watched the game so you know is it possible to write lively prose about politics yeah no not yet so we were sort of all over the map one of the one of the things about chess that you'll there's a question I once asked on Quora that didn't get a lot of response which was what is the greatest brilliancy ever produced by a computer in a chess game which was different than the question of what is the greatest chimera played so if you think about brilliance ease is what really animates many of us to think of chess as an art form those are those moves and combinations that just show such Flair panache and and and insole computers weren't really great at that they were great positional monsters and you know recently we've started seeing brilliance ease yeah and so if you're grandmasters have identified with that without Fazil that things work quite brilliant yeah so that's it that's it you know that's an example of something we don't think that that's a GI but in a very restricted set set of rules like chess you're starting to see poetry of a high order and and so I'm not I don't like the idea that we're waiting for Asia a GI is sort of slowly infiltrating our lives in the same way that I don't think a worm should be you know that C elegans shouldn't be treated as non conscious because it only has 300 neurons and maybe just has a very low level of consciousness because we don't understand what these things mean as they scale up so am I worried about this general phenomena sure but I think that one of the things that's happening is that a lot of us are fretting about this in part because of human needs we've always been worried about the Golem right well the gums the artificially created life you know it's like Frankenstein to ash or characters it's a Jewish version and Frankenberg frankerz yeah that's make sense that's right so the but we've always been worried about creating something like this and it's getting closer and closer and there are ways in which we have to realize that the whole thing is kind of with the whole thing that we've experienced are the context of our lives is almost certainly coming to an end and I don't mean to suggest that we won't survive I don't know and I don't mean to suggest that it's coming tomorrow it could be three hundred five hundred years but there's no plan that I'm aware of if we have three rocks that we could possibly inhabit that are sensible within current technological dreams the earth and the Moon and Mars and we have a very competitive civilization that is still forced into violence to sort out disputes that cannot be arbitrated it is not clear to me that we have a long-term future until we get to the next stage which is to figure out whether or not the Einsteinian speed limit can be broken and that requires our source code our source code the stuff in our brains to figure out what we mean by our source code the source code of the context whatever it is that produces the quarks the electrons the neutrino our source code I got it so this is your idea best stuff that's written in a higher-level language yeah yeah if that's right you're talking about the low-level bits so that's what is currently keeping us here we can't even imagine you know we have Harebrained Schemes for staying within the Einsteinian speed limit you know maybe if we could just drug ourselves and go into a suspended State or we could have multiple generations I think all that stuff is pretty silly but I think it's also pretty silly to imagine that our wisdom is going to increase to the point that we can have the toys we have and we're not going to use them for 500 years speaking of Einstein I had a profound break that when I realized you're just one letter away from the guy yeah but I'm also one letter away from Feinstein it's well you get to pick okay so unified theory you know you've worked you you enjoy the beauty of geometry well I don't actually know if you enjoy it you certainly are quite good at its trouble before trembled before it that if you're a religious that is one of the can I have to be religious it's just so beautiful you will tremble anyway I just read I sign his biography and one of the ways one of the things you've done is tried to explore a unified theory talking about a 14 dimensional observers that has the 4G space-time continuum embedded in in it i I just curious how you think and how philosophically at a high level about something more than four dimensions how do you try to what doesn't make you feel talking in the mathematical world about dimensions that are greater than the ones we can perceive is is there something that you take away that's more than just the math well first of all stick out your tongue at me okay now on the front of that yeah there was a sweet receptor and next to that were salt receptors in two different sides a little bit farther back there were sour receptors and you wouldn't show me the back of your tongue where your bitter receptor with I'm sure the good side always okay that was four dimensions of taste receptors but you also had pain receptors on that tongue and probably heat receptors on that tongue so let's simply get one of each that would be six dimensions so when you eat something you eat a slice of pizza and it's got some some some hot pepper on it maybe some jalapeno you're having six dimensional experience dude do you think we overemphasize the value of time as one of the dimensions or space well we certainly overemphasize the value of time because we like things to start and end or we really don't like things to end but they seem to but what if you flipped one of the spatial dimensions into being a temporal dimension and you and I were to meet in New York City and say well where where and when should we meet say how about I'll meet you on 36th in Lexington at 2:00 in the afternoon and eleven o'clock in the morning that would be very confusing well so it's a convenient for us to think about time you mean all right we happen to be in a delicious situation in which we have three dimensions of space and one of time and they're woven together in this sort of strange fabric where we can trade off a little space for a little time but we still only have one dimension that has picked out relative to the other three it's very much Gladys Knight and the pips so which one developed four who did we develop for these dimensions or did the dimensions or were they always there and it doesn't well do you imagine that there isn't a place where there are four temporal dimensions two and two of space and time or three of time in one of space and then would time not be playing the role of space why do you imagine that the sector that you're in is all that there is I certainly do not but I can't imagine otherwise I mean I I haven't done ayahuasca or any any of those drugs that hope to one day but I said up doing ayahuasca you could just head over to building two that's where the mathematicians are that's where they hang just to look at some geometry we'll just ask about pseudo Romani and geometry that's what your interest is okay or you could talk to a shaman and end up in Peru and then it's an extra money for I won't be able to do any calculations if that's how you choose to go about it well a different kind of calculation so decide yeah one of my favorite people Edward Frenkel Berkeley professor author of love and math great title for a book said that you were quite a remarkable intellect to come up with such beautiful original ideas in terms of unified theory and so on but you are working outside academia so one question in developing idea as a truly original truly interesting what's the difference between inside academia and outside academia when it comes to developing such you know it's a terrible choice terrible choice so if you do it inside of academics you are forced to constantly show great loyalty to the Consensus and you distinguish yourself with small almost microscopic heresies to make your reputation in general and you have very competent people and brilliant people who are working together who are informed very deep social networks and have a very high level of behavior at least within mathematics and at least technically within physics theoretical physics when you go outside you meet lunatics and crazy people mad men and these are people who do not usually subscribe to the consensus position and almost always lose their way and the key question is will progress likely come from someone who is miraculously managed to stay within the system and is able to take on a larger amount of heresy that is sort of unthinkable in which case that will be fascinating or is it more likely that somebody will maintain a level of discipline from outside of academics and be able to make use of the freedom that comes from not having to constantly affirm your loyalty to the consensus of your field so you've characterized in ways that I could academia in this particular sense is declining you are posted to plot the older population of the faculty is getting larger the younger is getting smaller and so on so what's which direction of the - are you more hopeful about well the baby boomers can't hang on forever what's it first of all in general true and second of all in academia but that's really what what this time is about is the baby we didn't we're used to like financial bubbles that last a few years in length and then pop yeah the baby boomer bubble is this really long-lived thing and all of the ideology all of the behavior patterns the norms now for example string theory is an almost entirely baby-boomer phenomena it was something that baby boomers were able to do because it required a very high level of mathematical ability you know you don't think of string theory as an original idea oh I mean it was original to Veneziano it probably is older than the baby boomers and there are people who are younger than the baby boomers who are still doing string theory and I'm not saying that nothing discovered within the large strength theoretical X is wrong quite the contrary a lot of brilliant mathematics and a lot of the structure of physics was elucidated by string theorists what do I think of the deliverable nature of this product that will not ship called string theory I think that it is largely an affirmative action program for highly mathematically and geometrically talented baby boomer physics physicists so that they can say that they're working on something within the constraints of what they will say is quantum gravity now there are other schemes you know there's like asymptotic safety there are other things that you could imagine doing I don't think much of any of the major programs but to have inflicted this level of loyalty through a Shibboleth well surely you don't question XY question almost everything in the string program and that's why I got out of physics when you called me a physicist it was a great honor but the reason I didn't become a physicist wasn't that I fell in love with mathematics as I said Wow in 1984 1983 I saw the field going mad and I saw that mathematics which has all sorts of problems was not going insane and so instead of studying things within physics I thought it was much safer to study the same objects within mathematics there's a huge price to pay for that you lose physical intuition but the point is is that it wasn't a North Korean re-education camp either are you hopeful about cracking open Einstein five theory in a way that has been really really understanding whether it's the Uniting everything together with quantum theory and so on I mean I'm trying to play this role myself to do it well the extent of handing it over to the more responsible more professional more competent community so I think that they're wrong about a great number of their belief structures but I do believe I mean I have a really profound love-hate relationship with this group of people I think the physics side oh yeah because the mathematicians actually seem to be much more open minded and well they are in there aren't they're open minded about anything that looks like great math right right they'll study something that isn't very important physics but if it's beautiful mathematics then they'll have they have great intuition about these things as good as the mathematicians are and I might even intellectually at some horsepower level give them the edge the theoretically reticle physics community is bar none the most profound intellectual community that we have ever created it is the number one there is nobody in second place as far as I'm certain look in their spare time in the spare time they invented molecular biology well what was the original molecular biology you're saying for something like Francis Crick I mean a lot of a lot of the early molecular biologists well physicists yeah I mean you know the Schrodinger wrote what is life and that was highly inspirational I mean you have to appreciate that there is no community like the basic research community in theoretical physics and it's not something I'm highly critical of these guys I think that they were just wasted that you know decades of time with and your religious devotion to their Mis conceptualization of where the problems were in physics but this has been the greatest intellectual collapse ever witnessed within academics you see it as a collapse or just a lull oh I'm terrified that we're about to lose the vitality we can't afford to pay these people we can't afford to give them an accelerator just to play with in case they find something at the next energy level these people created our economy they gave us the rad lab and radar they gave us two atomic devices to end World War two that created the semiconductor and the transistor to power our economy through Moore's law as a positive externality of particle accelerators that created the world wide web and we have the insolence to say why should we fund you with our taxpayer dollars no the question is are you enjoying your physics dollars right these guys sign the world's worst licensing agreement and if if they simply charged for every time you used a transistor or a URL or enjoyed the piece that they have provided during this period of time through the terrible weapons that they developed or your communications devices all of the things that power our economy I really think came out of physics even to the extent the chemistry came out of physics and molecular biology came out of physics so first of all you have to know that I'm very critical of this community second of all it is our most important community we have neglected it we've abused it we don't take it seriously we don't even care to get them to rehab after a couple of generations of failure all right no one I think the youngest person to have really contributed to the standard model of theater article-level was born in 1951 all right Frank will check and almost nothing has happened that in theoretical physics after 1973-74 that sent somebody to Stockholm for a theoretical development that predicted experiment so we have to understand that we are doing this to ourselves now with that said these guys have behaved abysmally in my opinion because they haven't owned up to where they actually are what problems they're really facing how definite they can actually be they haven't shared some of their most brilliant discoveries which are desperately needed in other fields like gauge theory which at least the mathematicians can can share which is an upgrade of the differential calculus of newton and leibniz and they haven't shared the importance of renormalization theory even though this should be standard operating procedure for people across the sciences dealing with different layers and different levels of phenomena and so shared you mean communicated in such a way that this it disseminates throughout the different signs these guys are sitting both theoretical physicists and mathematicians are sitting on top of a giant stock pile of intellectual gold all right they have so many things that have not been manifested anywhere I was just one Twitter I think I mentioned the harbor man switch pitch that shows the self duality of the tetrahedron realized as a linkage mechanism now this is like a triviality and it makes an amazing toy that's you know built a market hopefully a fortune for Chuck Hoberman well you have no idea how much great stuff that these priests have in their monastery so it's truly a love and hate relationship for you yeah well it sounds like it's more on the love this building that we're in right here yes is the building in which I really put together the conspiracy between the National Academy of Sciences the National Science Foundation through the government university industry research roundtable to destroy the bargaining power of American academics using foreign labor with on microfiche not in the basement oh yeah that was done here in this building is that weird and I'm truly speaking with a revolutionary and a radical no no no no no no no no no no no at an intellectual level I am absolutely garden-variety I'm just straight down the middle the system that we are in this this university is functionally insane Harvard is functionally insane and we don't understand that when we get these things wrong the financial crisis made this very clear there was a long period where every grown-up everybody with a tie who spoke in a you know in baritone with the right degree in at the end of their name which talking about how we banished volunteer volatility we were in the Great Moderation okay they were all crazy and who was who was right it was like Nassim Taleb right Nouriel Roubini now what happens is is that they claimed the market went went crazy but the market didn't go crazy the market had been crazy and what happened is is that it suddenly went sane well that's where we are with academics academics right now is mad as a hatter and it's it's absolutely evident I can show you a graph after graph I can show you the internal discussions I can show you the conspiracies Harvard's dealing with one right now over its admissions policies for people of color who happened to come from Asia all of this madness is necessary to keep the game going what we're talking about just on where around the topic of revolutionaries is we're talking about the danger of an outbreak of sanity yeah you're the guy pointing out the elephant in the room here and the elephant has no clothes see how that goes I was gonna talk a little bit to uh Joe Rogan about this man at a time well I think you're you have some you just listen to you you could probably speak really eloquently to academia on the difference between the different fields so you think there's a difference between science engineering and then the humanities in academia in terms of tolerance that they're willing to tolerate so from my perspective I thought computer science and maybe engineering is more tolerant to radical ideas but that's perhaps innocent of me is that I always you know all the battles going on now are a little bit more in the humanity side and Gender Studies and so on have you seen the American Mathematical Society publication of an essay called get out the way and not what's what's the idea is that white men who hold positions within universities and mathematics should vacate their positions so that young black women can take over or something like this that's in terms of diversity which I also want to ask you about but in terms of diversity of strictly ideas sure do you think because you're basically saying physics as a community has become a little bit intolerant to some degree to new radical ideas or at least you you say that's changed a little bit recently which is that even string theory is now admitting okay we don't this doesn't look very promising in the short term right so the question is what compiles if you want to take the computer science metaphor what will get you into a journal will you spend your life trying to push some paper into a journal or will it be accepted easily what do we know about the characteristics of the submitter and what gets taken up and what does not all of these fields are experiencing pressure because no field is performing so brilliantly well that it's revolutionizing our way of speaking and thinking in the ways in which we've become accustomed but don't you think even in theoretical physics a lot of times even with theories X string theory you could speak to this it does eventually - what are the ways that this theory would be testable and so ultimately although look there's this thing about popper and the scientific method that's a cancer in a disease and the minds of very smart people that's not really how most of the stuff gets worked out it's how it gets checked all right so there is a dialogue between theory and experiment but everybody should read Paul Dirac's 1963 American Scientific American article where he you know it's very interesting he talks about it as if it was about the Schrodinger equation and Schrodinger's failure to advance his own work because of his failure to account for some phenomenon the key point is that if your theory is a slight bit off it won't agree with experiment but it doesn't mean that the theory is actually wrong but Dirac could as easily have been talking about his own equation in which he predicted that the electrons should have an antiparticle and since the only positively charged particle that was known at the time was the proton Heisenberg pointed out well shouldn't your antiparticle the proton have the same mass as the electron and doesn't that invalidate your theory so I think that Dirac was actually being quite potentially quite sneaky and talking about the fact that he had been pushed off of his own theory to some extent by Heisenberg but look we've fetishized the scientific method and popper and falsification because it protects us from crazy ideas entering the field so you know it's a question of balancing type 1 and type 2 error and we're pretty we were pretty maxed out in one direction the opposite of that let me say what comforts me sort of biology or engineering at the end of the day does the thing work yeah you can test the crazies away and the crazy eight well see now you're saying but some ideas are truly crazy and some are are actually correct so well there's pre correct currently crazy yeah right and so you don't want to get rid of everybody who's pre correct and currently crazy the problem is is that we don't have standards in general for trying to determine who has to be put to the sword in terms of their career and who has to be protected as some sort of giant time-suck pain in the ass who may change everything do you think that's possible creating a mechanism of those select well you're not gonna like the answer but here it comes song boy it has to do with very human elements we're trying to do this at the level of like rules and fairness it's not going to work because the only thing that really understands this yeah read that read the double-helix it's a book oh-ho-ho-ho-ho you have like to read this book not only did Jim Watson half discover this three-dimensional structure of DNA he's also one hell of a writer before he became an ass that no he's tried to destroy his own reputation I knew about the ass I didn't know about the good writer Jim Watson is one of the most important people now living and as I've said before Jim Watson is too important a legacy to be left to Jim Watson and that book tells you more about what actually moves the dial and there's another story about him which I do don't agree with which is that he stole everything from rosalind Franklin I mean the the problems that he had with rosalind Franklin are real but we should actually honor that tension in our history by delving into it rather than having a simple solution Jim Watson talks about Francis Crick being a pain in the ass that everybody secretly knew was super brilliant and there's an encounter between chargaff came up with the the equimolar relations between the nucleotides who should have gotten the structure of DNA and Watson and Crick and you know he talks about missing a shiver in the heartbeat of biology and stuff is so gorgeous it just makes you tremble even thinking about it look we know very often who is to be feared and we need to fund the people that we fear the people who are wasting our time need to be excluded from the conversation you see and you know maybe we'll make some errors in both directions but we have known our own people we know the pains and the asses that might work out and we know the people who are really just blowhards who really have very little to contribute most of the time it's not 100% but you're not going to get there with rules right it's using some kind of instinct I mean I to be honest I'm gonna make you roll your eyes for a second but and the first time I heard that there is a large community of people who believe the earth is flat actually made me pause and ask myself the question why would there be such a community yeah is it possible the earth is flat so I had to like wait a minute I mean then you go through a thinking process that I think is really healthy it ultimately ends up being a geometry thing I think it's an interesting it's an interesting thought experiment at the very least well is I don't I do a different version I say why is this community stable yeah that's a good way to analyze it what interesting that whatever we've done has not erased the community so you know they're taking a longshot bet that won't pan out you know maybe we just haven't thought enough about the rationality of the square root of two and somebody brilliant we'll figure it out maybe we will eventually land one day on the surface of Jupiter and explore it right these are crazy things that will never happen so much as social media operates by AI algorithms you talked about this a little bit recommending the content you see so on this idea of radical thought how much should a I show you things you disagree with on Twitter and so on in Twitter or at verse in it about these nice clothes yeah yeah cuz you don't know the answer no no no look we've been that they've pushed out this cognitive Lego to us that will just lead to madness it's good to be challenged with things that you disagree with the answer is no it's good to be challenged with interesting things with which you currently disagree but that might be true so I don't really care about whether or not I disagree with something or don't disagree I need to know why that particular disagreeable thing is being pushed out is it because it's likely to be true is it because is there some reason because I can write I can write a computer generator to come up with an infinite number of disagreeable statements that nobody needs to look at so please before you push things at me that or disagreeable tell me why there is an aspect in which that question is quite dumb especially because it's being used to almost very generically by these different networks to say well we're trying to work this out but you know basically how much do you see the value of seeing things you don't like not you disagree with because it's very difficult to know exactly what you articulated which is the stuff that's important for you to consider that you disagree with that's really hard to figure out the bottom line is the stuff you don't like if you are a Hillary Clinton supporter you may not want to you it might not make you feel good to see anything about Donald Trump that's the only thing algorithms can really optimize for currently everything no they can do better this is weird think so now we're engaged in some moronic back-and-forth where I have no idea why people who are capable of building Google Facebook Twitter are having us in these incredibly low level discussions do they not know any smart people do they not have the phone numbers of people who can elevate these discussions they do but this then optimizing for a different thing and they are pushing those people out of those rooms they're they're optimizing for things we can't see and yes profit is there nobody nobody's questioning that but they're also optimizing for things like political control or the fact that they're doing business in Pakistan and so they don't want to talk about all the things that they're going to be bending to in Pakistan so that we're involved in a fake discussion you think so you think these conversations at that depth are happening inside Google you don't think they have some basic metrics under user engagements you're having a fake conversation with us guys we know you're having a fake conversation I do not wish to be part of your fake conversation you know how to cool you know these units you know high availability like nobody's business my Gmail never goes down almost see you think just because they can do incredible work on the software side with infrastructure they can also deal with some of these difficult questions about human behavior human understanding human you're not you thinking I mean I've seen that I've seen the developers screens that people take shots of inside of Google yeah and I've heard stories inside of Facebook and Apple we're not we're engaged they're engaging us in the wrong conversations we are not at this low level here's one of my favorite questions why is every piece of hardware that I purchase and in in tech space equipped as a listening device where's my physical shudder to cover my lens we had this in the 1970s a cameras that had lens caps you know how much would it cost to have a security model pay five extra bucks why is my indicator light software controlled why when my camera is on do I not see that the light is on by putting it as a something that cannot be bypassed why have you set up my all my devices it's some difficulty to yourselves as listening devices and we don't even talk about this this is this thing is total fucking bullshit yeah well I hope these discussions are happening about privacy this is their different more difficult thing you're giving it's not just privacy yeah it's about social control we're talking about social control why do I not have controls over my own levers just have a really cute UI where I can switch I can dial things or I can at least see what the algorithms are you think that there is some deliberate choices being made here is emergence and there is intention there are two dimensions and the vector does not collapse onto either axis but the idea that anybody who suggests that intention is completely absent is a child that's really beautifully put and like many things you've said is gonna make me connections can I turn this around slightly look yeah I sit down with you and you say that you're obsessed with my feet uh-huh I don't even know what my feet is what are you seeing that I'm not I was obsessively looking through your feed on Twitter because it was really enjoyable because there's the Tom layer element is the humor in it by the way that feed is Eric or once yeah i'm twitter edgar ik are weinstein answers it why why did i find any enjoyable or what it was I seeing what are you looking for why are we doing this what is this podcast about I know you've got all these interesting people I'm just some guy is sort of a podcast gift sort of vodcast you know you're wearing a tie I mean not even we're not even a serious interview searching for meaning for happiness for a dopamine rush so short term and long term and how are you finding your way to me what it what it what is I don't honestly know what I'm doing to reach you the representing ideas which feel common sense to me and not many people are speaking so it's kind of like the dog the intellectual dark web folks right they these folks from Sam Harris to Jordan Peterson to yourself are saying things where it's like you're like saying look there's an elephant he's not wearing any clothes and I say yeah yeah let's have more of that conversation that's how I'm finding you I'm desperate to try to change the conversation we're having I'm very worried we've got an election in 2020 I don't think we can afford four more years of a misinterpreted message which is what Donald Trump was and I don't want the destruction of our institutions they all seem hell-bent on destroying themselves so I'm trying to save theoretical physics trying to save the New York Times trying to save our various processes and I think it feels delusional to me that this is falling to a tiny group of people who are willing to speak out without getting so freaked out that everything they say will be misinterpreted and that their lives will be ruined through the process I mean I think we're in an absolutely bananas period of time and I don't believe it should fall to such a tight number of shoulders to shit shoulder this way so I have to ask you on the capitalism side you mentioned that technology is killing capitalism or it has effects that are unintended but not what economists would predict or speak of capitalism creating I just want to talk to you about in general the effect of even an artificial intelligence or technology automation taking away jobs in these kinds of things and what you think is the way to alleviate that whether the and rank presidential candidate with universal basic income ubi whether your thoughts there how do we fight off the negative effects of technology that aren't your software guy right yeah a human being is a worker is an old idea yes a human being has a worker is a different object all right yeah so if you think about object-oriented programming as a paradigm a human being has a worker and a human being has a soul we're talking about the fact that for a period of time the worker that a human being has was in a position to feed the soul that a human being has however we have two separate claims on the value in society one is as a worker and the other is as a soul and the soul needs sustenance it needs dignity it needs meaning it needs purpose as long as your means of support is not highly repetitive I think you have a while to go before you need to start worrying but if what you do is highly repetitive and it's not terribly generative you weren't in the cross hairs of four four loops and while loops and that's what computers excel at repetitive behavior and when I say repetitive I mean meat I mean things that have never happened be through combinatorial possibilities but as long as it has a looped characteristic to it you're in trouble we are seeing a massive push towards socialism because capitalists are slow to address the fact that a worker may not be able to make claims a relatively on languished median member of our society still has needs to reproduce needs to head to dignity and when capitalism abandons the median individual or you know the bottom tenth or whatever it's going to do it's flirting with revolution and what concerns me is that the capitalists aren't sufficiently capitalistic to understand this you really want to court authoritarian control in our society because you can't see that people may not be able to defend themselves in the marketplace because the marginal product of their labor is too low to feed their dignity as a soul so it my great concern is that our free society has to do with the fact that we are self organized I remember looking down from my office in Manhattan when Lehman Brothers collapsed in thinking who's going to tell all these people that they need to show up at work when they don't have a financial system to incentivize them to show up at work so my complaint is first of all not with the Socialists but with the capitalists which is you guys are being idiots you're courting revolution by continuing to harp on the same old ideas that well you know try and try harder bootstrap yourself yeah to an extent that works to an extent but we are clearly headed in place that there's nothing that ties together our need to contribute and our need to consume and that may not be provided by capitalism because it may have been a temporary phenomena so check out my article on anthropic capitalism and the new gimmick economy I think people are late getting the wake-up call and we would be doing a better job saving capitalism from itself because I don't want this done under authoritarian control and the more we insist that everybody who's not thriving in our society during their reproductive years in order to have a family is failing at a personal level I mean what a disgusting thing that we're saying what would horrible message who who the hell have we become that we've so bought into the chicago model that we can't see the humanity that we're destroying in that process and it's I hate I hate the thought of communism I really do my family has flirted with it decades past it's a wrong bad idea but we are going to need to figure out how to make sure that those souls are nirn nourished and respected and capitalism better have an answer and I'm betting on capitalism but I got to tell you I'm pretty disappointed with my team so you're still on the capitalism team you just uh there's a theme here graphical reticle capital right right on capitalism yeah I want I think hyper capitalism is gonna have to be coupled to hyper socialism you need to allow the most productive people to create wonders and you've got to stop bogging them down with all of these extra nice requirements you know nice is dead good has a future nice doesn't have a future because nice ends up with with goo legs damn that's a good line okay last question you tweeted today a simple quite insightful equation saying imagine that every unit F of Fame you picked up s stalkers and H haters so I imagine s and H or dependent on your path to fame perhaps a little bit but it's not as simple people always take these things literally when you have like 280 characters to explain yourself [Laughter] Soumya that's not a mathematical no there's no law okay okay I just said why I put the word imagine because I have loved a mathematician desire for precision you imagine that this were true but it was a beautiful way to imagine that there is a law that has those variables in it and you've become quite famous these days so how do you yourself optimize that equation with the peculiar kind of Fame that you have gathered along the way I want to be kinder I want to be kinder to myself I want to be kinder to others I want to be able to have heart compassion or these things are really important and I have a pretty spectrum II kind of approach to analysis I'm quite literal I can go full Rainman on you at any given moment no I can yeah its faculties of autism if you like and people are gonna get angry because they want autism to be respected but when you see me coding or you see me doing mathematics I'm you know I speak with speech apnea uh me right Debra dinner you know yeah we have to try to integrate ourselves and those tensions between you know it's sort of back to us as a worker and us as a soul many of us are optimizing one to thee at the expense of the other and I struggle with social media and I struggle with people making threats against our families and I struggle with just how much pain people are in and if there's one message I would like to push out there you're responsible everybody all of us myself included was struggling struggle struggle mightily because you it's nobody else's job to do your struggle for you now with that said if you're struggling and you're trying and you're trying to figure out how to better yourself and where you failed where you've let down your family your friends your worker is all this kind of stuff give yourself a break you know if if if it's not working out I have a life long relationship with failure and success there's been no period of my life where both haven't been present in one form or another and I I do wish to say that a lot of times people think this is glamorous I'm about to go you know do a show with Sam Harris people are gonna listen in on two guys having a conversation on stage it's completely crazy when I'm always trying to figure out how to make sure that those people get maximum value and that's why I'm doing this podcast you know just give yourself a break you owe us you owe us your struggle you don't owe your family or your co-workers or your lovers or your family members success as long as you're in there and you're picking yourself up recognize that this this new situation with the economy that doesn't have juice to sustain our institutions has caused the people who've risen to the top of those institutions to get quite brutal and cruel everybody is lying at the moment nobody's really a truth teller try to keep your humanity about you try to recognize that if you're failing if things aren't where you want them to be and you're struggling and you're trying to figure out what you're doing wrong which you could do it's not necessarily all your fault we are in a global situation I have not met the people who are honest kind good successful nobody that I've met this chick is checking all the boxes nobody's getting all tens so I just think that's an important message that doesn't get pushed out enough either people want to hold society responsible for their failures which is not reasonable you have to struggle you have to try or they want to say you're a hundred percent responsible for your failures which is total nonsense beautifully put Eric thank you so much for talking today thanks for having me buddy you
