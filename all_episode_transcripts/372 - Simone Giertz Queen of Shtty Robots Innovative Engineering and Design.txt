Franklin for welcome to the show pleasure so you just published a book world without mine the existential threat of big tech sounds ominous what was what was the impetus behind behind this book yeah it's a wee bit up apocalyptic minded I wrote this book I had just gotten fired as editor of The New Republic which was an incredibly traumatic experience for me I had worked at The New Republic for a really long time and wood had just come off this cycle of where the magazine had been bought like Chris Hughes who was 28 years old worth 700 billion dollars he'd been Mark Zuckerberg's roommate in college and one of the first really a co-founder of Facebook and he'd arrived at the New Republic with extremely lofty ambitions he said I share your commitment to serious journalism in the New Republic had been was a hundred-year-old magazine devoted to politics policy in fairly high culture he said I shared devotion to two seriousness I've got a lot of money and you guys have been struggling to master this digital world well I I co-founded social media so it seemed awesome and for a time it was extremely awesome but then there was a moment where he said look we really needed to generate revenue and the only way for us to do that is to produce pieces that will be very successful on Facebook and so we lived this just super compressed period in media history where we made this transition for being a magazine that prided itself on its originality and its seriousness to a magazine that was trying to pander to the algorithms of Facebook trying to produce journalism that would prove to be popular on Facebook and so it was it was it was a really really rushed transition and a new CEO came before the guy from Yahoo and as soon as he came aboard I kind of knew that I was doomed because it took him two weeks to meet with me anyway so I ended up I ended up realizing that I was about to get fired so I quit and a bunch of other people quit the magazine and it became this object lesson in the media about how Silicon Valley was swallowing journalism and why that was going bad and that was it just got me thinking along the lines of the ways in which journalism actually was a case study for the broader world and that everybody in the world is becoming so dependent on these platforms on Google on Facebook on Apple on Amazon and I I wanted to both productively channel my anger and also explore this problem that was it been extremely interesting me long before I'd run into trouble at the New Republic right and it's kind of a this idea the sort of the the concern about these tech companies is really hit the zeitgeist cuz we're seeing it with Amazon with Facebook especially Twitter even so yeah I mean feel like it's it's like in the air it's in the social yeah me loot well when I started writing this book actually Amazon was the was really my initial impetus just because I had been active in the Authors Guild which is a group that organizes on behalf of writers and when Amazon had been renegotiating its book contracts with the big publishers it was it was applying super brutal tactics and said we dominate this market and basically you have to accept our terms or you're toast and they would strip if a publisher was challenging Amazon they would strip the Buy button off of its books or they would point readers in other directions and so that was initially the thing that got me interested in these questions but when I did I said when I started writing this book people looked at me like I was a hippie howling into the wind these companies had such cultural prestige and by the time my book came out the zeitgeist had already started to shift I think in no small measure thanks to the election and all the questions about Facebook that arose out of the election but one radio interviewer last week asked me it accused me of mouthing conventional wisdom by criticizing these tech companies that thought wow the zeitgeist really has turned well is listen before we get into some of these criticisms I think it's important to understand because it's amazing these companies have just risen to power really fast I think sometimes we take for granted how fast they've come to dominate life our lives but I think to understand how that happened we need to understand the philosophical underpinnings that sure weren't that that exists in Silicon Valley so what are those underpinnings and what how has that helped them or sort of not help them you know directed how they've managed their businesses to where they're grown to these giant behemoths well one of the totally fascinating facts that Silicon Valley is that it wasn't just the birthplace of Apple the internet personal computer it was also the place where the counterculture came into being so alongside Steve Jobs you had the Grateful Dead you had LSD you had the communes and a lot of the spirit of the counterculture rubbed off on technology as technology rubbed off on the spirit of the counterculture and you had in the late sixties and early seventies a bunch of people headed off to two communes which was a doom a bit of a doomed experiment but that real spirit of wanting to tie everybody together in a communal sort of way of using technology to try to gin up a different sort of consciousness in the same sort of way that LSD had produced a different sort of consciousness those ideas came to infuse our ideas about technology and one of the most powerful ideas about technology that we have is this idea of stitching the world together into one and creating these massive new mechanisms these communes really that we can existent and that in Silicon Valley that became the basis for the idea of the network which is so ubiquitous or all these ideas about we think of Silicon Valley as being kind of libertarian which it is to a certain extent but it's also fundamentally collectivist and you see it in the concepts of crowdsourcing social media collaboration and networking and these ideas these networks these these kind of giant communes that they build our beautiful dreams but when they get captured by big firms they become the basis from monopoly yeah I mean I think that that weird tension between libertarian individualism and this utopian collectivism is really weird because you do see it and it's like I feel like the libertarian is I mean like there's like a few guys it's like well I'm the guy who can create this utopian collective network and so like that they encourage like you as little regulations as possible so they can achieve that yeah that's right I mean it's it's there's a way in which they're just asking for libertarian ISM selves and collectivism for everybody else and you see what you're getting at I think is one of the big themes of my book which is that there's there's hypocrisy that runs through a lot of these companies is that they they insist on transparency and sharing and everybody else's lives but when it comes to revealing Heather algorithms work they're completely opaque or you know Facebook is all about sharing but they were so reluctant to share basic information about what Russian ads were built were bought during the campaign yeah and I mean so one of the arguments so this collectivist idea of creating them and not like this is their idea of a lot of you hear a lot Silicon Valley is monopolies are good yeah so why do they okay you know you grew up in high school learning about how monopolies were terrible you had Teddy Roosevelt busting the trust what I do they think monopolies are a good thing well I think there's a business principle behind it which is that they believe that the world operates as a series of networks and so you can see this misses an old idea I mean railroads for networks to tie people together the phone companies operated networks that tied people together Facebook is the network that ties people together Google is a network that ties people into Google and the principle is that these networks work most efficiently when there's only one it just doesn't make sense for there to be since Facebook is kind of a global telephone book it doesn't make sense for there to be to global telephone books or it's a mechanism for staying in touch with people around the world well what if there were two of them and we were on it would just be sloppy and so it's the razón d'etre is kind of this idea of oneness the business idea is the one of oneness and so in Silicon Valley of the sense that once a firm captures the network it's not even worth competing with them because being second place in the network is just not going to yield a huge financial gain but it is I mean if there is a way in which all this is very different than the monopolies of old first is that these guys just possess so much data which is this intimate window inside your head this history of everything that you've read everywhere you've traveled and they you bought which is then used kind of increase your dependence on the network to keep you engaged for as long as possible or you could even see it say to a dick to you to their products the second thing is is that these companies are just so ambitious so there was kind of a limit to what the railroads could swallow even as they try to swallow up a bunch of stuff these companies are everything companies Google started off wanting to organize knowledge now it's building self-driving cars it's got a life sciences company that's trying to defeat death Amazon started off as the everything story now it's a movie studio Don's Washington Post Whole Foods it powers the cloud etc etc and there's really no end to the etceteras yeah I mean what's crazy though you know back in the 19th century climate to the railroads and the telephone companies even in the middle of the 20th century's that people the government and the public were like leery of monopolies and think they made took actions to you know break those up what's changed in the 21st century where people and even the government like well ok that's if whole who wants to buy or Amazon wants by Whole Foods ok that's great let's go ahead and do that what changed was in the 1960s there was famous article written by a law professor called Robert Bork and Robert Bork would later become famous because Ronald Reagan nominated him to the Supreme Court and his nomination was derailed by Democrats you got bored ya borked he got bored Singapore yeah right so working and you know what else cap worked was our antitrust laws because once upon a time there was our antitrust laws existed in order to preserve democracy that there was this fear that once you had private power start to amass into massive continent to amass untipped large concentrations that they would just be able to become way too influential in Washington and in elections etc but with pork the concern shifted to a concept that he called consumer welfare and so in his view everything was about price so so long as a big company kept prices low and so long as it didn't use outrageously bullying behavior on customers or in competitors then there was no problem with it and so everything in our antitrust laws became about price and efficiency and that was a big was a big turnaround in the concept of antitrust and what you've seen is every year since Robert Bork wrote his famous article in the 60s our interpretation of the antitrust laws is narrowed further and further until in the Obama administration I don't think they I don't think they broke up a company you know they did a lot to limit mergers but this idea that a company has become too big and powerful in its sector and deserves to be broken up it's just completely fallen by the wayside even though that was once something that the government would routinely do right so Bork did have I mean in these the monopolists do have a point like it does allow does creat lower prices right that that yeah absolutely and just can I be clear about one thing which is that I like I think Google is an incredible invention I think iPhones are are gorgeous pieces of engineering and design and I don't think we want to throw them all into the ocean and go back to some sort of world before the Internet I mean not at all I think we want to try to capture the good parts of it but when it comes to antitrust but is totally true which is that Google and Facebook are free like you can't argue that they're bad for consumers on those grounds right and Amazon keeps prices incredibly low and so if antitrust is gonna have an issue with these if we're gonna care about these monopolies we need to shift back to a pre-work sort of paradigm for considering companies so as as a threat to democracy or the government or something like that yeah totally I mean which is I mean which is really I mean that is that's the core right here and so not just to democracy and the government but I also think there the quat knees questions about privacy that loom extremely large and I do think that there are there are questions about the ways that treat competitors for instance I mean if classic example is with a Google treated Yelp so once upon a time when you wanted to go to dinner you typed in typed in the restaurants name into Google and a yelp review came out and then Google saw that and so ah Yelp is a pretty good business we should be owning that space and so Google started to aggregate reviews and what do you know when you type the restaurants name into Google suddenly Yelp got pushed down by the algorithm and so Google was creating a marketplace that advantaged itself and so I don't want to completely surrender there are causes for economic concern right I guess Amazon does this too like they're they're tracking data on which products sell well and they'll end up just creating that company for themselves to sell that product and there's like a report that came out that like there's a lot of brands that Amazon owns that people don't know that Amazon owns yeah and I was just reading an article this morning in the New York Times that was describing the way in which Amazon so Amazon doesn't really like the book publishers and it's kind of allowed for a shadowy gray market to exist where you can buy books used that have been that are basically review copies that have been purchased or other copies that have been bought on that had been bought on it on a secondary market and they use that to undercut the the list price that that has been set by the publishers and that Amazon's seemingly has accepted and so the point is that Amazon is not operating on the basis of fair market rules they're not abiding by contracts they're kind of allowing this system to exist in order to sneakily stick it to these publishers who've been a pain in their ass I mean besides this threat to you know privacy to democracy it's said I mean I think one of the underlying threats made this pretty explicit was just these companies are a threat to like just the idea of the individual or individuality or individualism can you explain what you mean by that a little bit more right well I mean at the biggest level if you think about it this way these machines are they're just different than other machines right so uh we've had tools ever since we emerged as a species we've had hammers we've had clouds we've had factories that automated a per body strength but these machines are intellectual machines and that they they're designed to amplify and replace intellectual activities and a lot of that is great so I don't need to worry about sense of direction anymore because I've got Google Maps and ways but it also means that when I'm merging with my machine I'm merging with emerging with the companies that operate those machines and these companies have an agenda for influencing us they have a view of human nature where they're trying to to steer us and it's towards a vision where we're integrated into their systems and the way that they want that make them the most money and to be the biggest issue one of the biggest issues has to do with the ways in which they commandeer our attention so this is the one that will be most the example that'll be I think familiar to every single one of your listeners which is the iPhone is it's like constantly beckoning us if it's in another room we feel like a limb has been cut off our bow and within this time almost Pavlovian sort of way these phones have been reverse-engineered to mean that they're always they're always screaming for our attention they buzz constantly with notifications we sleep with our phones and it's in a way they're trying to they're trying to they're trying to own our attention they want us they want everything to be on their platforms and it's incredibly destructive to our ability to to be to have a sense of self to be to be individuals when you're when we're just kind of all guinea pigs in this experiment that they're running on us right speaking of experience like Facebook has admitted to running giant social experiments where they've been able to sway people to do certain things just based on the information they have you know present to the user totally and I'm glad you mentioned that because when I talk about this a lot of times I think people look at me like I'm a crank and then I'm concocting some sort of conspiracy but really a lot of this is just so explicit that Facebook has submitted to social scientists using its platforms in a way to run experiments on us as individuals where they try to manipulate our emotional mood or they try to sway us to go to the voting booth they're just incredibly explicit about how you know if you work for these companies you know that everything is being tested all the time to maximize engagement to maximize the amount of time that you spend on the site and so headlines are being manipulated the use of photos is being manipulated the way in which information on facebook is ordered it's being manipulated all to increase your levels of engagement right and then one of the other arguments you make sort of the hypocrisy these companies that they say say that they've taken they've eliminated the gatekeepers right no more publishers and editor's no more you know people saying what can and cannot or what is worth you know putting out there but you argue I can no they've just they're the gatekeepers now they are the gatekeepers of the biggest most powerful gatekeepers in a way in human history and there is this hypocrisy about it where they they've amassed all this power everything flows through the gates journalism is hugely dependent on Facebook and Google for traffic in therefore for revenue publishing is totally dependent on Amazon and they're just a massive chunks of the economy that are dependent on these companies and these companies have the ability to pick winners and losers what Facebook decides comes up highest and his algorithms are going to be the things that are gonna be most popular the things that they decide to suppress in their algorithms are gonna be the things that that don't get attention and it's an incredible amount of power yet they they claim to have they refuse to admit that they hold that sort of power which is part of the reason why they've come under such heated attack right now after the election then we can see that they created a system in which they news propaganda have flourished the ways in which it was so easy for bad actors to come into their system and to use it in order to manipulate people yet Facebook was incredibly reluctant to admit that it had any responsibility over any of that and it's going back to the consumer how these monopolies hurt consumers okay we get free information low prices in Amazon but you know you argue that like the quality of that information we get for free has gotten crappier yes right be your example of the New Republic is a great example first it was it took pride in writing this very long form in-depth thorough articles and then you were left having to right-click Beatty you know you don't won't believe what happened next type stuff in order to drive traffic because that's what does well on these social platforms right exactly and that it's created this is another way in which it's it's kind of destroying individuality which is that everybody who depends on Facebook is constantly trying to latch on to the thing that's trending that is most popular there because what facebook wants are the things that are going to be popular those are gonna be the things that will keep people most engaged and so there's this shift and ethos towards the Facebook and ethos which Facebook looks like it's promoting individual individual expression and it does to some extent but on balance you'd have to say that's also creating a new herd mentality and new form of conformism and homogenous ation right right yeah I guess another example you talked about the publishing industry how Amazon allows anyone to publish a book but one of those books are just garbage he's had these unfortunately right I mean you have people just cranking out like freshly in the fiction rule just cranking out like fiction books like faster than just like the these like dime-store you know westerns from the 19th century is just just trying to make as much money as possible but Amazon allows that it encourages it because it's it's the thing that Amazon is no different than these other companies they want addictive products it's true in the realm with television and video by the way to where the quality is sometimes higher but in this idea of binge watching is is you know again they want your attention for as long as possible and we're just in the early days of the ways of which that's going to be monetized and as Amazon turns turns more and more to advertising your binge watching is going to be a bigger and bigger source revenue for them and so this is this is not a new phenomenon we've always been you know the couch potato is a time-honored American tradition but given the data that they have and the way that they understand you their ability to addictive you is going to be much much higher and the pulp but just to return to your when you're trying to bring out of me which is this point about quality which i think is hugely important because if you think about it as citizens we have to make really important decisions every couple years about who gets elected to public office and in order to make good decisions we need to have good information and if Facebook is just giving us what we what it thinks that we want it means it's confirming our bias biases and it's in some ways intellectually incapacitating us and so the implications for democracy are pretty catastrophic ya know so the external threat you know the things like about the democratization and like the worsening of quality of content like Instagram comedians are the bane of my existence and YouTube comedians like they're not funny at all but yeah but they do like they do well on the platform for some reason I don't know I'm on this mission to take down Instagram comedians alright we'll see if we can happen make it happen I you know what my thesis could be spun off and applied to other vectors of human life I think so yeah yeah well I think Jerry Seinfeld has complained about that before comedians and you know people who write for television they had like they were put through the wringer right you no longer have to do that and so as a consequence you don't really get the cream anymore rising to the top right right well so what's the solution to this is it just okay you said it's like we don't have to give up on the internet but what do we do to counter that or if you know we're you know yeah what can we do on our on our personal level and maybe on a societal level policy solutions about the return possibility of having taking those anti-monopoly laws that have grown so dusty and haul them off the shelf and applying them I think we could think about we could because even about breaking up some of these companies the Europeans are moving to in a way break up Google try to several of its advertising business from some search business could easily imagine doing the same thing to Facebook here it's gobsmacking just truly gobsmacking that there's no law protecting your data given how intimate it happen you know we tell it we tell our machines things that we would never tell our friends and these companies are sitting there holding that data sometimes selling it on an open market and it needs to be protected on a personal level let me ask you a personal question do you sleep with your phone I don't well god bless you ha ha when did you decide to give that up or did you never do it I think I just never really did it I just kind of I don't really where my phone ends up that's word that word ends up and that usually does not buy me so so there's that I also don't have a personal Facebook account Wow Wow I stop you are the resistance I am the reason and it's it's that it's for that reason because I'm just freaked out by how much Facebook can know about you so yeah I got it I got to stop that well I mean look it's really hard it's better it's almost better to not start than to engage and try to disengage because the human reasons for kind of being drawn to these devices the the way in which we crave attention the way in which we all our anxieties and insecurities are amplified by these devices it's kind of horrifying and once you're once you're once you're stuck in their experiments it's really it's very very hard to get out and so I mean I struggle with this I honestly struggle with this I've taken I don't have facebook on my phone anymore I shot I killed all the notifications on my phone I I try not to sleep with my phone although they're nights where I find myself kind of doing it because I want to listen to a podcast a or because I you know you decide to need your alarm and you'd remember old-fashioned alarm clock nearby because you're traveling or what-have-you and Facebook is just damn it's like I don't I don't really do a whole lot of posting on it but the boy eristic aspect of it is so real I don't know Twitter but when you tweet something you sit around waiting for to see how people respond to it and it's like this craving of affirmation and this desire not to say something that causes people to shame you and there's it's it's really these emotions that they're messing with they're really really powerful I would just say that would you know we'd either we've got lots of other powerful forces in our lives when it comes to the foods that we eat and our compulsion to chow down or there's there's alcohol or what-have-you and we learn to we're going to eat and drink with with relative moderation except for some outlier cases and I think it's possible even despite all the powerful forces at work to do the same thing with technology just to use it in a balanced sort of way where you're able to reap its benefits without permitting yourself to to be a lab rat in their experiment yeah yeah I don't have a problem with like the social networks Facebook or Twitter like Amazon's the one that freaks me out because we do have a LexA in our house and I don't know about Alexa I'm kind of I'm a little suspicious of her now I don't know if she's like always listening to what I'm saying it could be I don't know well yeah that's right if you say Alexa she's like what's up yeah but is she also listening to just conversations I mean it they could do that right Amazon could sneak in something in their Terms of Service or like we'd do this and then then when you go to amazon.com you see an ad or you see like a product recommended product for this thing you were talking about with your wife right that could happen that and that's creepy that is really creepy yeah well it's kind of the design right is that you're supposed to be the ideas that these companies these devices are supposed to know you in a way that better than you know yourself and that way they can anticipate your desires and they can I mean this is another aspect in which individual of some individuality are threatened is that these companies want you to offload decision-making on to them so here's a creepiest the creepiest thing that I think is bubbling up which is onna beaut listen to either Zuckerberg or Alon must talk about how they want to read your brainwaves right yeah I don't like that I don't know how the hell that could happen I mean it seems like it seems so outrageous to me that that could actually be developed just on a scientific level it I don't I don't get it but then again I never really imagined that you'd have a handheld device that were you'd be able to watch every television show ever created or every book ever read that was like a fantasy that was kind of beyond my wildest imaginations as a kid so maybe they can pull it off maybe they pull it off yeah they want you to become part of the hive mind then the new was a new and you you or something that I don't know the idea that that Facebook could I wouldn't even need to type it would just it would just I could just think and it would suddenly poster it would suddenly reveal whatever my my my inner thoughts are he seems to me to basically I kind of exposes the agenda of the company right but that's there that that's our next end goal I mean that is that is the that is the complete disappearance of privacy when some of these able to read your brain yeah like Zuckerberg has made that like he wants that to happen like he says we wanted but he wants to get rid of privacy yeah because he says it's good it's good for society right like even put it all out in the air look if if your girlfriend if your girlfriend you like if there was a possibility of your girlfriend oh she was cheating on her you wouldn't cheat and that's kind of basically what you say because of that that that's a big that's basically what he's saying that if our public selves merged with our private selves we would be we'd be morally better human beings and we would also he also claims we would be more forgiving of people because everybody else everybody would constantly be making mistakes and those mistakes would be exposed so you're right I mean it's it's I always find it fascinating to sit there and read through everything that he said on the subject simply because it's so radical and there's such a there's such a such a loud view of human nature embedded and what you saying it creeps it hard yeah I mean they're also going back to the idea of diminished individual individuality like if you know your thoughts are being read like you are less likely to engage with possibly I don't say just like risky thoughts like risky ideas which that could put a stifle on all sorts of things scientific advancements advancements in psychology etc etc you just reading my brain right now yeah I was no but you're already kind of seen that already people censor themselves self censor online because you might get you know it gets picked up on Twitter and then the the mob comes out with the pitchforks and here's an example from everyday life which is when I was when I was started working offices were thing then and so you had doors that you could close while you were working and people would come into your office and you could talk behind closed doors with them and so if you had an idea that you were thinking about for some new thing you could tell somebody that new idea and private without worrying about the embarrassment of saying something stupid or saying something that was offensive but now everybody works in an open office space and conversations happen on slack or other chat platforms and so every idea is now turned around in public and so if you have a new idea you're not closing the door you have to think before you post and so you become more cautious in pitching new ideas to become you become more terrified about offending or about about you you just become you become as you say less that's subversive you what's innovative you become you become flattened as an individual in that type of environment right which goes against the argument that the Silicon Valley people make that you know it's out you know open source stuff leads to better things not necessarily the case no I don't know why I mean these things get up I'm so ideological in Silicon Valley where openness transparency these things become become mantras that they try to force on to everybody else when all right in some instances they're great they work really well like Wikipedia is an amazing thing and we should you don't want Wikipedia to disappear it's a great example of collaboration working but no I don't think that that's necessarily should become our foundational belief for the future of human civilization which is the way that they tend to carry their ideas some curious have you noticed any weird things with your book on Amazon or Facebook because of the things you say about them yeah man I be I don't know why I'm not number one of the New York Times bestseller list I think it's Amazon now as I was reading this is like wondering okay I wonder if Amazon's gonna put the kibosh on his book well he uh Franklin this has been a great conversation where can people go to learn more about the book well there's this invention called the internet if you were to go to you know fire up go duck duck yeah that's what I that's what I use for search that's my my default search to I'm trying to like do what I can to fight I'm the yeah the reason is I'm part of the resistance or you know what here's something I want to like your your listeners you know that secret if you get in your car somewhere within proximity of your house I think that there might be a store where they sell books oh yeah okay yeah it's not so not not Amazon go to a store yeah I mean look by far far be it for me to dissuade your listener buying my book on Amazon if they bought my book on Amazon look I know your apartment progress is a judgment-free zone so I don't think that they should feel any sense of social program no they are doing we're big proponents of being an individual rugged rugged individual you do what you want yeah all right well hey Franklin for thank you so much for your time it's been a pleasure okay thank you I guess it was Franklin for he's the author of the book world without mine the existential threat of big tech it's available of course on Amazon which we talked about today or if you don't want to do that go to your local book store and pick up a copy as if there as well also check out our show notes at am is slash world without mind where you
