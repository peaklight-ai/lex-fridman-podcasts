speaking of which you have launched an extremely successful companies you have helped others you've invested in companies can you give advice on how to start a successful company I would say have a problem that you really really really want to solve right something that you're deeply passionate about um and honestly take the first step like that's often the hardest and don't overthink it like you know like this idea of a minimum viable product or a minimum viable version of an idea right like yes you're thinking about this like a humongous like super elegant super beautiful thing what like reduce it to the littlest thing you can bring to Market that can solve a problem or that can I you know that can help um address a pain point that somebody has they often tell you like start with a customer of one right if you can solve a problem for one person then there's probably myself or some other person right pick a person exactly it could be you yeah that's actually often a good sign that if you enjoy a thing right enjoy a thing you have a specific problem that you'd like to solve that's a good that's a good end of one to to focus on right what else what else is there to actually so Step One is the hardest but there's other steps as well right um I also think like who you bring around the table early on is so key right like being clear on on what I call like your core values or your North Star it might sound fluffy but actually it's not so and Roz and I feel like we did that very early on we sat around her kitchen table and we said okay there's so many applications of this technology how are we going to draw the line how are we going to set boundaries we came up with a set of core values that in the hardest of times we fell back on to determine how we make decisions and so I feel like just getting Clarity on these courts like for us it was respecting people's privacy only engaging with Industries where it's clear opt-in so for instance we don't do any work in security and surveillance um so things like that just getting we very big on you know one of our core values is human connection and empathy right and that is yes it's an AI company but it's about people well these are all they become encoded in how we act even even if you're a small tiny team of two or three or whatever um so I think that's another piece of advice so what about finding people hiring people if you care about people as much as you do like it and it's it's it seems like such a difficult thing to uh to hire the right people I think early on as a startup you want people who have um who share the passion and the conviction because because it's going to be tough like I've yet to meet a startup where it was just a straight line to success yeah right even even not just start up like even in everyday people's lives right there you always like how run into obstacles and you run into naysayers and um so you need people who are believers whether they're people on your team or even your investors you need investors who are really Believers in what you're doing because that means they will stick with you they won't they won't give up at the first obstacle yeah I think that what about raising money
