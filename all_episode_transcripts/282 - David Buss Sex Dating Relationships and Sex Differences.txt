what do women want tell me what all the things women want in a long-term mate and so i would start at one end of the blackboard there were like five blackboards and they said well i want a mate who's who's kind who's understanding who's intelligent who's healthy who's got a good sense of humor who shares my values and and i just go and fill five blackboards and then run out of space so then i turn to the men and i say well what do men want and then i i run out of space after about a blackboard and a half because they they can't think of anything else so the women i think there's a lot of explanations for that the following is a conversation with david buss evolutionary psychologist at ut austin researching human sex differences in mate selection he's considered one of the founders of evolutionary psychology and has authored many exciting and challenging books including the evolution of desire strategies of human mating bad men the hidden roots of sexual deception harassment and assault and the murderer next door why the mind is designed to kill we talk a lot about sex dating relationships and love i take these at times controversial topics very seriously but i also try to inject humor and ridiculousness throughout this conversation and all conversations i do please do not mistake my silliness for lack of seriousness and my seriousness for a lack of silliness and above all do not mistake my suit and tie or my phd as a sign of intelligence or wisdom i barely know what i'm talking about on most days i'm simply curious and hoping to understand the way a child does what the heck is going on in this weird and wonderful civilization of ours if i say something stupid as i often do i promise to learn and to improve as mark twain said i do not want my schooling to interfere with my education open-minded curiosity i think is the best guide for a proper and fun lifelong education this is the lex friedman podcast to support it please check out our sponsors in the description and now dear friends here's david bus what is more important in the history of the development of human civilization sex or violence so mating strategies or military strategies oh well both are important i mean uh first of all humans are sexually reproducing species and so everything has to go through sex you know so in our our mating psychology has to be very rich and complex because uh to succeed for us to be here now all of our ancestors in an unbroken chain have had to succeed in selecting a fertile mate attracting that mate be mutually chosen by that mate stay together long enough do all the sexual things you need to do to reproduce have the kids survive etc so everything has to go through mating and in that sense i think it's uh i mean survival is really only a means to an end if you if you will uh so uh so sex has got to be important and humans have a very rich evol sexual psychology or an evolved mating psychology okay but uh i wouldn't minimize the importance of violence either there's a ton of evidence that humans evolved in the context of small groups and with a fair amount of small group warfare so intertribal warfare uh where uh and this is a harsh realization but there historically um this is part of our bad evolutionary history it has been advantageous from a purely reproductive standpoint to conquer a neighboring group kill the males and get whatever resources they have including females and and sexual resources to as well as tools weapons territory and so forth and so um and so i think that we have uh of course it's it's typically males um who do that i mean yes some females have participated in warfare but as far as i know there's never been a single case in all of human recorded history of women forming a war tribe with other women to attack another group of women and kill them and capture the men as husbands but the these uh this phenomenon is common um in the ethnographic record and small group uh studies um it's part of our common thing so just one concrete example unfortunately he's dead now he passed away napoleon chagnon who studied the yanamamo for many many years um when he first started interviewing them he he asked them you know why do you go to war um and they said well to to capture women of course what it's the only sensible reason and they said you know why do why does your culture go to war or however they phrased it and he said well you know we could work for to spread democracy and ideas and everything they basically fell off their logs laughing at such a stupid reason because why risk your life for anything um other than women of course it's more complex than that because some go to war for reputational reasons they say if we if we don't retaliate because we've been attacked and they've stolen three of our women if we don't retaliate then we will get a reputation as exploitable and then other groups will start to attack us as well and so they get into these cycles of um you know like the hatfields and mccoys of attacks counter-attacks retribution and part of it is is um reputation management um so that's that's between groups and and i think that's been the the primary source of violence but not the only source so there's also within group conflict and so many ethnographies many traditional societies have things some of them are ritualized like wrestling matches or in diana mama they have uh these uh we're used to these uh chest pounding duels where so if we're in this match you challenge me and i have to of course chest pounding duel like this yeah yeah so it's not you're not hitting each other you're just it's like peacocking you oh no you're hitting each other oh sorry yeah so they they get 20 paces away and they they run up and you punch the other guy in the chest and he has to basically stand there and then he does the same and everything oh wow uh and then it's basically last man standing that's well i suppose that's better than the face that's an interesting decision with the chest yeah i mean i'm sure if you get good at that kind of thing you could start breaking ribs yeah and you can get loose about the rules of where exactly in the chest you can hit whatever and there's that guy who's always known for hitting not exactly in the chat right where is it only missing right right the the mike tyson of eating your ear off so interesting so there's like ritualized uh conflict sort of uh you purify the um the competition that that that resolves some kind of issue well yeah it's important to establish status hierarchies you know um but um but also and here's here's just another one more concrete point on on that the yanaman we don't have this in our language we just have one word for kill or murder but mama have um you're either an una if you're a male you're an unokai or a non-unokai the non-unokai are men who have not killed if you're an unokai that means you have killed someone and the unokai among the anamomo historically had higher status and more wives said they're a uh poliginous uh society which is which has been true of um something like 83 to 85 percent of uh traditional societies were actually i was just corrected by a anthropologist she said we no longer call them traditional societies we call them small-scale societies so nothing can be called traditional i i don't know bacteria the traditional society yeah yeah i think it's just uh one of these things the language the word the the words that are deemed appropriate to use to describe things change over time so yeah so words can hurt people they can inspire people words are funny powerful things you authored the textbook titled evolutionary psychology the new science of mind in its uh sixth edition what is the magic ingredient that gave birth to homo sapiens do you think is it fire cooking ability to collaborate share ideas ability to contemplate our own mortality all that kind of stuff yeah well i think it's hard to isolate one factor i know uh i know you've had richard wrangham on this podcast it was a wonderful wonderful interview and uh he used to be a colleague of mine when i was a professor at michigan and um i've stayed in touch with him uh on off he's a brilliant brilliant guy and he thinks fire and cooking have been one of the key things but i think it's hard to isolate i would trace at least part of our uniqueness to uh the uniqueness of our mating system so we have in in mating uh unlike chimpanzees who are our closest primate relative and of which richard wrangham is is a world's expert but they have basically no long-term pure bonded mating okay they female comes into estrus all the mating all the sex happens most of the sex happens during that window but humans have evolved long-term pure bonded mating uh and it's it's only one mating strategy but it's a really important one and then you have with that male parental care so basically again we go back to chimps and chimps with whom we share more than 98 of our dna males don't do anything so they inseminate the females but then when the kids are born they basically don't do much of anything in terms of provisioning and so forth but human males do we invest in the modern environment could be decades you know especially with the boomerang kids and everything but we're not all males do but compared to the vast majority of mammals we are a very heavy male parental investment species could you uh if it's okay and i'll ask you a bunch of dumb basic questions because those are fun uh could you define mating here how we is mating refer to the the the series of sexual acts that lead to reproduction is it include like dating and love and camaraderie uh loyalty all those things yes uh i you know yes yeah when i first started studying yeah i don't respect it's when i first started studying it i looked for the right term and obviously it's much broader than sex so by mating i include things like mate selection mate preferences made attraction mate retention mate poaching um made expulsions i mean poaching that sounds fun so the early the uh the game theoretics strategy made selection is primary with mating what meeting is about or do you include the long term once uh you agree that you're gonna stick this out for a while and have multiple children is that also amazing yes i include that as well so it's it's a broad category broad definition and and absolutely includes the emotion of love um and of course there are many different types of brotherly love love parents for children uh but love i think uh and this is one of the shifts in the social sciences so when i was an undergraduate for example i was taught that love is this um invention by some caucasian european poets a couple hundred years ago and um and it turns out that's not the case so you you there's been extensive cross-cultural evidence now that um that people not every person in all cultures of course but all some people in all cultures experience this emotion that we call love and for the word love are we going to in this conversation try to stick to sort of romantic love for the the for the meaning of the word love well they're uh that's that's a great question but um i mean they're uh it's pretty well established that there are these different phases of love so there's this uh infatuation phase where uh our psychology we we get obsessional thoughts it's hard to focus on work when we're not with the person we're thinking about the other person constantly uh so there's kind of like ideolog ideational intrusion into our psychology but you you can't sustain that i mean it would be uh and then of course there's a uh pardon the phrase but what i describe is the fucking like bunnies phase of of this you know intense sexuality but people have other adaptive problems they have to solve and so you can't stay in that state for too long and so that subsides over time and um and develops into uh at least in many cases this warm attachment cuddling bunnies long-term cuddling bunnies yes the face of the relationship but still romantic not like brotherly love or you know because i i talk about a lot of love a lot and for me you know love is a broader experience of just um experiencing the joy and the beauty of life so like just looking out in nature yeah that's the kind of love like whatever the chemicals that lead to a feeling that at least echoes the same kind of feeling that you get with romantic love you can experience that with even inanimate objects that sounds weird to say but just a gratitude and appreciation um not in some kind of uh weird zen way but just in a very human way just it feels good to be alive kind of yeah yeah yeah i guess i i would i mean that's an interesting thought i hadn't thought about that i guess there i would use other terms to describe that so like the term ah for example when you see a beautiful sunset you know that's why i kind of started out by saying i think there are different types of love and i'm focusing on the mating type and we'll talk about that but so yeah there is a sense of beauty and there's a sense of sexual appeal maybe that's a good and those intersect in fascinating ways we'll we'll talk about that okay we'll talk about all that but you're saying mating strategies not that we've kind of uh placed ourselves what we mean by mating mating strategies is one of the cool features that made humans what they are one of the initial inventions is is the weird uh weird and wonderful ways that we mate yeah and i mean if you go to even things like um how we compete for mates and this is another kind of strange for some people angle on it but mating is inherently a competitive process in that desirable mates are in secure supply relative to the numbers of people who want them and so even even post mating after that is after mate selection made attraction a mutual mate choice uh desirable that's why there's mate poaching mate poaching is one of the strategies that we in my lab with david schmidt have studied and so okay but one of the unique aspects of humans is that we compete using language and that is we have reputations and humans devote a lot of effort to maintaining their reputations to building their reputations to trying to recover uh reputations after uh a loss of reputation for various reasons but we we compete for mates um using language and that includes sending signals to the person that we're trying to attract using language um verbal fluency and you know obviously some more recent things like poetry but also we use language to derogate our competitors so one of the papers i published very early on it was a research project on derogation of competitors the the ways in which people impugn the status character and reputations of their rivals with the goal of making them less desirable to other people and humans do that and uh women and men both do that so it's an interesting thing that were male competitions we were talking about the yanamamo earlier and some of these overt physical or what what animal biologists call contest competition where there's a physical battle uh males do that and so a lot of the early attention on mate competition was focused on these sort of ostentatious overt battles in contest competition but we compete through language um and uh and so there's this big overlooked domain of women the ways in which women compete with each other using language and one of the things that astonished me is how observant women are about the subtle imperfections in their rivals and take pains to point them out so just just this is uh two random examples i went to a party this is back in in my youth but went to a party with uh my girlfriend at the time and uh and i got into this conversation with another woman who happened to be very attractive but um but then we leave the party and she said something just casually off-handed like said did you notice that um her thighs were heavy and i hadn't but next time i saw her this other woman i found my attention being drawn to check out her thigh well and originally it puzzled me why women would deregulate other women on appearance well they do it of course because men prioritize appearance but i thought well the man can see the woman directly with his own eyes why would verbal input alter his perceptions of how attractive he was and i think that part of it is i think there are actually a couple two quick answers to that one is the attentional one so our attentional field sure when they draw attention to it the those what could be very small deviations from perfect symmetry or whatever they are become magnified in our attentional field but the other is that um who we have as a mate is also a reflection of our own status um and and we you saw this in a kind of um overt and uh way in the uh the earlier the last presidential not the last part of the the uh 2016 presidential election where uh donald trump was saying this was when he was in competition with ted cruz i think in the primary he said look look at my wife look at ted cruz's life and wife and he really impugned the appearance of ted cruz's wife so using language you can alter the um the dynamics of the social hierarchy the status hierarchy sorry so like you can change the values subtly or if you have a large platform in big ways you can move things around just with your words yeah yeah that's right right and fascinating because it's all socially constructed anyway so this uh i mean the question i have is you said there's the interesting thing about mating strategies is there's a small pool of desirable mates and what the word desirable means is socially defined almost by on purpose to make sure the pool always stays small i would have a couple thoughts on that now it's an interesting issue set of issues you raise okay one is that we i think we have evolved adaptations part of our psychology is to detect differences um and so this is why um like a i don't know a a martian or an alien coming down they might look at humans and say boy they all look alike as one just like we look at i don't know zebras or whatever we think they all look look alike um but what's important in decision making especially in the mating domain or even friendship domain or or coalitional selection domain is the differences and and so i i noticed this just a concrete example of this uh i was sitting around this is again ages ago uh watching a um something like a miss america beauty contest and people in there with a bunch of other people and they were saying boy did you see miss north carolina what a dog and and so yeah this is astonishing so here are like a 50 contestants who are selected as the most attractive in their state presumably um although they claim it's based on talent um but um but we noticed the differences um and and uh and this is why i would push back a little bit on the term socially constructed because i think it's um there are many different meanings of that of that phrase and one meaning that some people have one connotation is that it's arbitrary and i don't think it's arbitrary so uh this has been another shift in understanding standards of beauty where it used to be believed in the in the social sciences you can't judge a book by its cover beauty is only the skin deep uh you know don't judge people on the superficial characteristics but in fact physical appearance provides a wealth of information about the health status of someone their in the case of males their physical formidability and we have formidability assessment adaptations and then fertility as well so there are a very predictable set of cues to fertility that have evolved to be part of our standards of attractiveness and and they're not arbitrary there are some culturally arbitrary ones so like you go to the the maori in new zealand for example and they find tattoos on their lips to be very attractive so there are some culturally arbitrary things um but standards of beauty like uh cues to youth cues to health uh in women clear skin uh full lips clear eyes lustrous hair um a small waist hip ratio that is circumference of the waist relative to the hips uh is a cue to youth infertility and and acute health symmetrical features so we are a bilaterally bilaterally symmetrical species but we all have we all have uh deviations from perfect symmetry that are due to different things so mutation load uh environmental insults diseases during development and so forth all right but that that's kind of deeply biological like there's cues that indicate something that is biologically true about a particular human so if we we'll talk about both men and women uh so we're now talking about what men want in the mating strategies when they look at women so you're saying small waist to hip ratio right is how much of that is our deep biological past on top of which we can build all kinds of different standards of beauty so you know we have many things going on in our brain our value of other humans in selecting a mate might uh incorporate a lot more variables as we get into the 21st century so how quickly does our valuation of a mate uh evolve relative to the evolution of um the human species they're using evolving the sense of culturally culturally evolved and then relative to biologically evolve yeah uh well i think that there are um there are some things that are biologically evolved some standards standards of attractiveness um and there are some of the things that i mentioned so in male evaluation of females let me back up and just say what is the underlying logic why would we have standards of attractiveness so um here's the interesting thing and this gets back to your earlier question about what is unique to humans or what distinguishes us or what set us off on the path that we did is chimpanzee males do not have any difficulty figuring out when a female is fertile she signals that like crazy with the bright red genital swelling uh olfactory cues she goes into estrus in humans we have and this was actually a third thing that i wanted to add earlier we have concealed ovulation okay relatively concealed ovulation which is remarkable given how close we are primatologically to to chimpanzees and so um uh there's there's a little bit of evidence that there are subtle changes that occur when women ovulate non women not on hormonal contraceptives but it's mostly concealed but it is it is largely concealed i think that's a feature of bug in uh like do we evolve that is that is that a cool and a powerful invention for the human species i think it's it's an adaptation in women that women have evolved concealed ovulation and i think it's a feature not a bug it gives more would it give more power for women to select a mate there are a couple different hypotheses about it but the one that i think is most plausible uh is that you know if again comparing it to chimps fema goes into estrus the male just has to try to monopolize her while she's in that estrus phase and then they basically ignore the females after that if you can't know when if when a woman is fertile then you have to stick around a lot longer and so i think long-term pair bonding co-evolved with concealed ovulation and with that also a very different form of sexuality which is that we have sex throughout the ovulatory cycle um and uh chimps don't you know there's there's a little bit of mating a little bit of sex toward the edges of the um ester cycle but but very little so that that actually makes mating a more fundamental part of um interaction between humans than it does for chimps so meaning like year-round every day i'm constantly selecting amazing in terms of biologically speaking so what else what else do men want today in the 21st century versus in the caveman days a wonderful question to answer it though i have to distinguish between long-term mating and short-term mating uh and in long-term mating it gets very complicated so as as a uh that's one way to put it yeah uh well well so i teach a course in in human sexuality at university of texas at austin and um one of the things this was back in the days when there were chalkboards and you and you taught with a piece of chalk and wrote things on the board and what i would do is i would ask the class i'd teach this the large class one to 200. i'd say what do women want tell me what all the things women want in a long-term mate and so i would start at one end of the blackboard there were like five blackboards and they said well i want a mate who's who's kind who's understanding who's intelligent who's healthy who's got a good sense of humor who shares my values and and i just go and fill five blackboards and then run out of space and and so you the first this large number of characteristics that people want and then specific magnitudes of those characteristics or or amounts so i say you you want a mate who's say generous with their resources and they say yes i what makes jennifer the research so i said so like a guy who this is a women's mate selection the guy who at the end of every month gets his paycheck and gives it to the uh local wino um on on the dragon i said well no not that generous okay generous toward me not not indiscriminately generous and so you want a mate who's um ambitious you know who's a hard worker yes but but not a workaholic you know and so uh and so then you get to interactions among different characteristics so there's a lot of characteristics a lot of variables in this very complex optimization problem for women yes that's right and more so for women than for men so and then i turned it to men and i say well what do men want and then i i run out of space after about a blackboard and a half because they they can't think of anything else so the women i think there's a lot of explanations for that besides the lack of the number of variables it's also you know um i mean that's interesting so what what's the difference between the variables so on the men's side what are the variables well they're in long-term base flexion there there's a lot of overlap sure okay um so things like intelligence um good health sense of humor um an agreeable personality someone who's not too neurotic or moody or or emotionally volatile but there are key differences as well and the differences stem from they basically fall on the delimited number of domains so for men it's physical attractiveness physical appearance and youth are the two real big ones okay men prioritize those more than women do and so that's why you have phenomena such as uh this quote love at first sight where sometimes men can walk into a party and they see a woman across the room and say that i'm going to marry that woman that's the woman for me women very rarely do that now most men do don't do that either but men are much more inclined to fall in love at first sight that's because they prioritize physical appearance why because physical appearance provides that this wealth of information about a woman's fertility status and this is from from an evolutionary perspective from a purely reproductive perspective in in a business school they would call it job one job one is you have to select a fertile mate so those who in our evolutionary past who selected infertile mates so post-menopausal women for example um did not become our ancestors so we are all the descendants of this long and unbroken chain of ancestors who all of whom success succeeded in selecting a fertile mate but fertility cannot be observed directly uh it can't use some cues exactly and and there are cues that are probabilistically related to this underlying quality of fertility that we can't observe directly and we're doing that computation in our heads what about men what do men want for short-term mating well so for short-term mating um for both sexes uh physical appearance uh looms very large so so inc so women are no physical attractiveness and appearance they're important for women in long-term mate selection so i don't want to um mislead anyone on that they're just not as important as they are for men um and so a lot of characteristics come for women before physical appearance physical attractiveness um so women so if we switch to women what do women want they want also physical appearance for short-term mating yeah phys physical attractiveness what else uh well some cues that represent physical attractiveness that maybe represent health well here's this is your i'm learning a lot here yeah well so but you're also asking a very interesting question about uh what is a controversial within the evolutionary psychology field right right and not totally resolved so that's why you're on the sixth edition of the book and there could be a lot more additions coming yeah i revised it every four years or so because there's four years of um new interesting work and so it deserves updating but the traditional i should say uh answer to your question is that women go for good genes cues to good genes in the short term and cues to resources in the long term and this has been a hypothesis that advocated i didn't come up with this this one um by um steve gangstad a former student of mine marty hales and randy thornhill and some other um very smart players in the field and um and what they used as uh markers of good genes are things like symmetrical features uh and masculine features so strong jawline high shoulder to hip ratio you know other other sorts of masculine features but i started to doubt this explanation for what women want in the short term because of some other findings so for for women a lot of short-term mating is not one-night stand mating so but rather it's uh a fair mating so uh so if you ask the question why do women have affairs so let's restrict the question for a moment my colleagues would argue well women have affairs because they're trying to get good genes from one guy while they're getting an investment from the regular partner the the husband okay but the problem is that when women have affairs uh 70 plus percent tend to fall in love with or become attached to their a fair partner now outside what percentage 70 yeah 70 some large majority yeah 70 percent or more in contrast to men where it's more like 30 percent of men who have affairs fall in love with or become attached to their fair partner so but from a design perspective um an engineering perspective if you will uh that's a disastrous thing if you're just trying to get good genes so you're trying to retain the investment of one guy yeah while getting good genes surreptitiously from this you know guy who presumably has more falling in love with them becoming attached that's that's not a feature you want yeah it's bad engineering yeah exactly it's bad engineering and so and so i developed a an alternative uh hypothesis that i call the mate-switching hypothesis which is that um affairs are one way in which women divest themselves of a a cost inflicting partner or a partner who things aren't working out well with and it's a way to either transition back into the mating market or to or to trade up in in the mating market uh and and so and anyway so these are these are probably the two leading hypotheses about why why women have affairs and i am putting my money on the mate switching hypothesis um my esteemed colleagues are putting their money on the good genes hypothesis but i think the evidence for the good genes hypothesis is starting to um look shakier than initially but this is a heated debate i mean made squishing sounds like a so from a game theory perspective from an engineering perspective seems to make a lot more sense unless you put a lot of value in lifelong sort of in the long term mating uh some kind of value in the um lifelong singular relationship like monogamy yeah and maybe we do psychologically maybe there's a big evolutionary advantage to that and we we do but we also know that divorce is you know um and breakups are are also common that occur in all cultures so yeah um we're just not very good at this thing well either we're not good at the mate selection such that uh maybe we're we're not incorporating all the variables well or we're just not good at monogamy period from an evolutionary perspective well i think they're that's a debate no that's raises an interesting set of questions so i think that i mean one issue is is longevity so i mean we didn't live to be 70 80 years old and over 99 of human evolutionary history and so we didn't necessarily evolve to be mated monogamously with one person for decades and decades and decades but i also think that long-term peer bonding is a critical strategy but mate switching is also a critical strategy so if you have a mate for example who becomes cost inflicting or becomes sufficiently debilitated or who suffers an injury such that like in hunter-gatherer societies where the mate can no longer hunt can no longer provide resources for their kids and and and the woman this becomes this becomes a problem and so uh and so i think that we have adaptations to mate switch and to divest ourselves from some partners and trade up in the mating market under certain conditions so okay and those conditions will differ from men and women what are some of the cues in terms of what women want um you know i'll go to the gym so a hotly contested debate you said evolutionary psychology and this is uh in the uh bro psychology forums that i visit uh multiple times a day and no i'm just kidding uh what what what's the most important cue of appearance for guys um what muscle group is the most important to work on do women care about biceps is what i'm asking in terms of physical appearance um uh a a good um shoulder to hip ratio so relatively wide shoulders relative to hips um is is one women tend to prefer men who are uh physically fit and well toned but not muscle bound so like if you go to oh i don't know someone like those early when arnold schwarzenegger was doing the mis mr whatever it was contest you see the women don't find those attractive the extremely muscle-bound guys but they like a guy who's physically fit high shoulder to hip ratio they like guys who are physically taller than they are and guys who are a bit above average in in height so if the average so if uh you know the average is i don't know five nine five ten and out there for humans depending on the culture women prefer uh an inch or two taller than that um so um so shoulders height dad bod wha what's that about why don't why why do you want a dad by what why do you why why not how do i define wait what is a dad bod dad bot is not muscle-bound okay so out of shape a little no no no just a little bit a little bit of uh uh cushion for the pushing i don't know what the kids call it these days uh but just a little bit a little bit of fat so what's why do they not want guys to be obsessed with their body is that or is that some evolutionary thing yeah i think that um women might interpret a guy who is so obsessed with his body that he's uh they might view that as a sign of narcissism yes um and that's not a good trait uh what about like cultures where large sort of overweight men are valued is that how do you explain like how much can we override the evolutionary desires with our sort of cultural fashions of the day that maybe represent other desirable aspects like wealth well wealth is resources have always been important um especially to women so is a man able to acquire resources and is he willing to dispense them to her and her kids so that's always important in traditional cultures that boils down to hunting skills so if so i have to call a friend kim hill who's uh probably the world's leading expert on the aceh of paraguay and uh and you ask him like what what leads to high status in the aceh in males hunting skills that's that's nice one the one thing the big variable and that's resources and that's resources now what's what's interesting about modern culture is we have cash economies but cash economies are relatively recent and you know historically there's over the vast uh 99 of human evolutionary history you weren't able to stockpile resources in the way that you are today um although there are interestingly certain ways you can do it so so like you you kill a large game animal okay you bring it back you get some status points because you give some to your family you can share it more widely with the group etc um but um but it's going to go bad right you can't just say i'm going to keep this carcass around for the next several months okay but and and i think i think it's a steve pinker who might have used coin this phrase that they they store the meat in the bodies of other people and so for example they store it in their friends so you know um hunting success is uh you know it's it's a hit or miss kind of thing so you might come back empty-handed four times out of five but and but when you do you share your meat with others and then when you know and then they reciprocate by sharing their meat with you and so and so you can store resources in the bodies of other people which is i think an interesting way to think about it but that can only go so far and when you have cash economies you have both the ability to stockpile resources but also this kind of explosion and inequality of resources and that's evolutionarily recent what about now this is the difference between the hubermann the excellent huberman lab podcast that you did that people should listen to he is a brilliant scientist a um sort of uh a rigorous analyst of what is true in the scientific community also helps you with great advice on how to live now in contrast to that i am a um a terrible uh uh almost idiotic level journalist so this is what you have to deal with another thing that people talk about that women care about is penis size does penis size matter for women in sexual selection well um there's controversy about that in the evolutionary psychology community well is there papers on penis size i wouldn't say a scientific paper so speculations about in nature or in science yeah yeah no nothing nothing that i've seen there um you know i i think that there's individual variability um so uh this is something that comes up again you know when i ask women in the class my classes you know what do women want some will say you know a large penis but i think there's variability um in in that preference and it also might depend in part on the variability in the woman's anatomy so um do you think there's something fundamental in terms of evolutionary psychology in terms of evolution or is this a quark of culture that's current that's maybe somehow connected to pornography or something like that yeah my my guess is it's it's something that's uh perhaps a quirk of culture or or something that is evolutionarily recent um but um but but i don't know i mean it's it's a topic that hasn't been explored much i've never done work on it and well somebody should do a phd uh sort of some archaeologist should do a phd on the history of human civilization and its evaluation of penis size and the correlation of penis size to the value of the male okay moving on another absurd question in terms of what men want again definitely not a huberman lab podcast question why do men let's say a large fraction of men love boobs well uh i think that uh you're one of the uh most cited evolutionary psychologists and this is what you signed up for this is these kinds of questions questions like this yeah well so again this is something i haven't studied directly but um uh scientifically yes yes uh but um but yeah there's been some work on that and and it's uh another cultural quirk perhaps no i don't think it's a cultural quirk because i think it's the uh the shape that matters a lot because shape is going to be a cue to fertility and so one of the things that humans are attracted to in the opposite sex is sexually dimorphic features and breasts are a sexually dimorphic feature and dymorphic mean difference between difference in morphology between males and females got it um diamond to morphic morphology uh so um and women don't develop uh breasts until um puberty or post-puberty uh and and so uh as a sexually demorphic characteristic we tend to be attracted that same is true by the way with the waist-to-hip ratio that we mentioned earlier uh prior to puberty males and females have very similar ways to ratios but at puberty um there's a differential uh hip development and fat deposition that creates a sexual dimorphism uh with respect to waist-hip ratio and so again that's men are attracted to this wasted ratio that no man consciously says that they find this woman more attractive than that woman they don't think ah she has a waist up ratio 0.70 that's exactly what i do but most men most men yes so isn't that fascinating that we just build these entire industries the fashion and what we find beautiful around these kinds of ideas and we just and then not just not just fashion and then we build uh we have uh sociological tensions about whether we should care about this kind of thing or not there's there's battles in that space it's it's like they seem so simple it's just the human body and we wear clothes first of all that's that's a funny thing what what's the why are we wearing clothes what's the shame aspect yeah of covering up the body is that another feature or is that what is that yeah that's a that's a that's an interesting question and i i don't know it's just like hiding uh ovulation maybe that's another hiding like uh maybe hiding is a great game theoretic thing to play with because it can give you it can give the powerless more power by covering well well maybe well i think there are a few things so one is the sort of arbitrary features of fashion and then the other is the aspects of fashion that attempt to um magnify are what is inherent in our evolved standards of beauty so for example um women tend to wear things that accentuate their waist hip ratio so i mean historically those in the old days corsets for example cinch the woman's waist and you wouldn't see fashion develop in a way that made a woman seem old unhealthy pock marked signs of open sores or lesions there are certain domains um design spaces that you wouldn't that no culture would develop um so but there are arbitrary features but sometimes they're not entirely arbitrary or they're arbitrary at one level of description but not another so for example fashion tends to be linked with status and that's why it constantly changes the high status people start wearing a certain type of clothing and then when the lower status people imitate them then they have to shift to signal their status and so i think the fashion and clothing is important linked to status so this is not you talking this is me i just want to make a a statement a profound statement that i think yoga pants now this is broadly speaking but yoga pants is one of the greatest inventions in human history there's fire and i'm just going to leave it there i'm a fan um and i have uh female friends that talk about how comfortable yoga pants are which is what i'm referring to when i say it's one of the greatest inventions because comfort and fashion is really um really important to me let me ask about sort of the sociological aspect of this so i've um i've talked to mark zuckerberg who uh the meta who's the ceo founder of facebook and now meta and owns i've heard of him yeah he's a yeah he uh he uh holds the american flag and likes the water anyway um so there's been criticisms of social networks and so on and i just want to ask you about the broader question here that there's uh object objectification of the human body in the media and that creates standards for young women for young men perhaps but more young women yeah um you mentioned to the cruelty that women can have towards each other in terms of well let's you know cruelty is already a moral judgment just you've made a statement about the fact that women uh seem to point out imperfections in other women um do you think it's a problem in our modern society that we objectify each other in this way do you think this is this is a fundamental aspect of our biology that we need to um suppress versus celebrate just like we might suppress our natural desire for violence if such exists um in modern society well a couple couple thoughts on that i i think it is um damaging um the uh the fact that uh so many images are displayed in in social media and so um what i would say is that there's what's called in in the field uh an evolutionary mismatch so we evolved in the context of small group living where there was make competition but your competitors were a small number of other potential individuals and so people do comparisons um okay but now what we have is uh this bombardment bombardment of our visual system and our sexual psychology and our mating psychology with with thousands and thousands of images uh that are not at all representative of who our actual competition is in in in the mating domain and so i think that um and there's actually evidence on this that um uh baz luhrmann actually said something like this in his uh sunscreen song i don't know if you've ever heard that but it's like i said it's a wonderful like string of advice song about advice but he says uh oh yeah yeah okay yeah he says don't read beauty magazines that will only make you feel ugly you know i think that there's truth to that that is especially with with women they look at all these images and you know of course they're photographed they're photoshopped uh they're they're highly selected and and not at all representative and so women compare themselves to that so i think this social comparison is an evolved feature of humans i mean males do it females do it but it's exacerbated in the modern environment in wildly evolutionarily mismatched ways and so i think i think that it is it is destructive it's harmful there's evidence that um it hurts women's self-esteem so here's just another uh factoid or fact if you will that at least in western cultures uh males and females have roughly the same overall average levels of self-esteem but once uh puberty hits all of a sudden women's self-esteem starts to drop and i think it's because when they enter make competition then they start elevating the importance they attach to physical appearance and then as you point out the the tremendous objectification that saturates social media and media in general is um it's damaging and harmful i don't know how to undo it though i don't know how to design a society that um that undoes that well one of the ways we undo things just like you pointed out is we use words when we manipulate society we manipulate social and status hierarchies using our words for ill and we can do the same for good and that's why there's a lot of click-bait articles about uh you know instagram um hit you know leading to a lot of suffering amongst uh teenage girls and all those kinds of things um i'm criticizing the clickbait bait nature and not the contents of the articles but you know and those articles hopefully become viral in a way that makes us rethink about how we build social networks that kind of allow us to to easily misrepresent how we look when we are quote-unquote influencers and what a mental effect it has on the um on young people that look up to those influencers but i guess you're it's not the objectification fundamentally that's the problem it's the inaccurate it's the fake news it's the yeah that's misrepresentation you still objectify uh the male body the female body but you do so uh while misrepresenting the actual truth and and so you're moving the average you're moving the standard representation of what a male should look like what a woman should look like and uh the dishonesty is the problem not the objectification here's just one other interesting empirical finding on that and it has to do with another dimension that i think is harmful and and that's the thinness dimension uh and so if you and these are studies originally done by paul rosen but they've been replicated where if you ask men okay what is your ideal figure in a woman and so they have these say nine figures that vary from very very thin to average to to plump men give it the midpoint they say the the the midpoint is in relative thinness or plumpness is what i value and you ask women what is your ideal body type for you they give it they say thinner but then if you ask them what do you think males ideal body type is they put it in exactly the same spot that they put their own idea which is thin and so there's actually an inaccurate perception of how thin men desire women to be uh and i think that's partly exacerbated by the the fashion industry where the the models are often real thin and you know they're the lure is that clothes hang better on thin models and then on tv they say you gain 15 pounds over what you really are or whatever but for whatever reason women misperceive how thin men want them to be and so you have this is another huge sex difference is eating disorders anorexia for example bulimia binging purging where these these disorder eating disorders are nine to ten times more common in women than men can i just take a small tangent because it is such a beautiful uh the sunscreen song such a beautiful one if i can read some of the words from it yeah i i really enjoy it yeah it's great it's a great song for people you should check it out it's called everybody's free to wear sunscreen i guess it's actually a speech to a class i don't know if that's artificial or real but it's it's a speech that gives advice and it goes ladies and gentlemen of the class of 97. i just remember it even now those those words where's sunscreen if i could offer you only one tip for the future sunscreen would be it a long-term benefits of sunscreen have been proven by scientists whereas the rest of my advice has no basis more reliable than my own meandering experience i will dispense this advice now enjoy the power and beauty of your youth oh never mind you will not understand the power and beauty of your youth until they're faded but trust me in 20 years you look back at the photos yourself and recall in a way you can't grasp now how much possibility laid before you and how fabulous you really looked you are not as fat as you imagined don't worry about the future or worry but know that worrying is as effective as trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing bubble gum the real troubles in your life are apt to be the things that never cost your worried mind the kind that blindsides you at 4 pm on some idol tuesday do one thing every day that scares you saying don't be reckless with other people's hearts don't put up with the people who are reckless with yours floss don't waste your time on jealousy sometimes you're ahead sometimes you're behind the race is long and in the end it's only with yourself remember compliments you receive forget the insults if you succeed in doing this tell me how keep your old love letters throw away your old bang statements stretch don't feel guilty if you don't know what you want to do with your life the most interesting people i know didn't know at 22 what they wanted to do with their lives some of the most interesting 40 year olds i know still don't for me that's true for 50 60 and 70 year year olds honestly get plenty of calcium be kind to your knees you'll miss them when they're gone maybe you'll marry maybe you won't maybe you'll have children maybe you won't maybe you'll divorce a 40 maybe you'll dance the funky chicken on your 75th wedding anniversary whatever you do don't congratulate yourself too much or berate yourself either your choices are half chance so are everybody else's enjoy your body use it every way you can don't be afraid of it or what other people think of it it's the greatest instrument you'll ever own dance even if you have nowhere to do it but in your own living room read the directions even if you don't follow them do not read beauty magazines they will only make you feel ugly get to know your parents you never know when they'll be gone for good be nice to your siblings they're your best link to your past and the people most likely to stick with you in the future understand that friends come and go but a precious few who should hold on work hard to bridge the gaps in geography and lifestyle for as older you get the more you need the people he knew when you were young live in new york city once i actually took this advice this is fascinating advice i remember this advice well uh it's broadly applied live in new york city once but leave before makes you hard live in northern california once but leave before makes you soft travel accept certain inalienable truths prices will rise politicians will philander you too will get old and when you do you'll fantasize that when you were young prices were reasonable politicians were noble and children respected their elders respect your elders don't expect anyone else to support you maybe you have a trust fund maybe you'll have a wealthy spouse but you never know when either one might run out never mess too much with your hair or by the time you're 40 it will look 85 be careful whose advice you buy but be patient with those who supply it advice is a form of nostalgia dispensing it is a way of fishing the past from the disposal wiping it off painting over the ugly parts and recycling it for more than it's worth but trust me on the sunscreen so this is uh thank you for allowing me to read it it's almost sentimental for me i don't know when i first heard it um but there's a few pieces of advice in that you know similar to like the poem if by roger kipling um there's some deep truths when you step back and look at it all and also the the places where you live because i i i lived for time in i guess northern california with google and so on and one of the reasons i had to leave is i was becoming i felt i was becoming soft this this is my own personal experience and the same is true for the uh uh the cities of the east they can if you're not careful make it hard because everybody's super busy and rushing around and and uh there's just a buzz to the city which is exciting it's empowering but it can it can it can change you in ways and so it's one of the reasons i'm here in austin i fell in love with the city because yeah it's been a great move and yeah i've lived on both coasts as well um boston area and then uh berkeley california so um so i'm familiar with both you end up in austin as a small side well uh well i got i got my undergraduate degree here uh and then left for 20 years and migrated around so went to berkeley uc berkeley for my phd harvard for my first job university of michigan and then a job opened up at university of texas for an evolutionary psychologist and so um they wanted me fortunately so i was very happy to so i've always loved austin i mean it's uh yeah the love never died it was there yeah yeah it's a great time i was glad that i left so and experienced well both coasts and also the midwest but um happy to be back in austin let me ask a difficult question now we did pretty good with some difficult questions already but there are people in this world today who believe that gender is purely a social construct you i think are not one of those people to you what are the difference between men and women how much of those differences are in nature and how much is nurture i guess if we you're asking the question morphologically or psychologically i assume you're asking psychologically the question is what it is and the answer sometimes the questions don't contain with them the trajectory you take with the answer right so i think i was asking both and the fact that both our thing is an interesting thing yeah so you wrote a book textbook i should say evolutionary psychology right yes those both of those words are in the book title psychology that's the human mind yes yeah how much of gender how much of sex is the human mind and how much of it is the biology the way that i phrase it so i i don't like um sort of dividing the world into two categories things that are biological versus things that are not biological um so the biology is actually defined as the study of life and life processes and so at that sort of abstract level everything we do is biological including culture and our capacity for culture which i think is an evolved capacity that humans have um when you get to the issue of sex and gender i mean one cut at your question is are there universal psychological sex differences um and the answer to that question is yes there are some so for example well and this is in in one of your areas of specialty uh engineering um one of the interesting things is that uh it's called the people's thing dimension so do you want an occupation you want a job that involves people social interaction or are you happy with a job that just involves things mechanical objects or computer code or whatever and this is one of the largest psychological sex differences that that exists and it's true in every culture so uh in terms of i don't know um magnitude of effects it's a an effect size of more than a standard deviation difference between the means um on this psychological sex difference and so one of the interesting things is so if you go to places like go to the most gender egalitarian cultures in the world so places like sweden uh or norway uh which are explicitly gender egalitarian and and are truly in many many ways and but you allow people freedom of choice the the some of these sex differences actually get larger the psychological sex differences and also assortment into different occupational uh choices um now but this this is not something that i study i study mating and the sex differences if you ask what are the where in what domains are the sex differences the largest it turns out they occur within the domain of mating and sexuality so our evolved sexual psychology our evolved mating psychology is to some degree sexually dimorphic okay with the uh very important asterisk that we're talking about overlapping distributions so there are some things that so if you look at human morphology um we talked about breasts earlier women have evolved functional breasts that's functional for lactation men don't so there's not no amount of culture or social coercion can cause men to have lactating breasts uh psychologically we don't see dimorphism that extreme where something is literally present in one sex and totally absent in the other so there's overlap in the distributions so i mentioned earlier that in the mating domain men men more than women on average prioritize physical appearance physical attractiveness relative youth women on average prioritize resources resource acquisition qualities that lead to resource acquisition like status ambition industriousness and so forth but there's overlap in the distribution so some women place the total priority on how physically attractive the guy is and uh some men view that as irrelevant and and and uh so the the point that i'm making is that there are there are psychological sex differences that um make some people uncomfortable um but you know it's one of these things where i'm a scientist uh i'm not a political advocate uh um and so i'm i adhere to the empirical data on empirical data are very strong in these domains so with respect to sex differences in the mating domain and sexuality and things we haven't talked about like desire for sexual variety and sex differences in the whole uh desire for short-term mating huge sex differences there and these have been documented universally in all cultures so okay now are there uh are there things that are culture specific or social cultural overlays onto these fundamental psychological sex differences absolutely but there's also an issue of um levels of analysis levels of abstraction and how closely you look at the phenomenon so quick analogy language so you say well um in china they speak chinese and korea they speak korean in brazil they speak portuguese they look how culturally infinitely variable languages are which they are at that level but do humans have a universal human innate grammar and i think the evidence points to the answer yes to that at least that's what steve pink or paul bloom and some other uh others argue so at one level of abstraction things are infinitely culturally variable or at least highly culturally variable and another level of abstraction there's universality so here's one example in the mating domain of this so margaret mead who is a famous um anthropologist studied the samoan islanders and she tried to argue basically for the infinite malleability of things like gender and gender roles and so forth she's and she said look at this culture the in this culture it's the men who paint their face whereas you know in western cultures it's the women who wear makeup and so forth well it turns out if you if you look carefully at the culture where men paint their face they're painting a war paint on their face they're not they're not putting on makeup to enhance their cues to youth and cues to health they're putting on war paint to make themselves more ferocious or to demarcate what tribe they're in what coalition they're in and so at sort of one level have a abstraction you could say well there's high cultural variability and application of face paint but on another level there's really a fundamental functional difference in the purpose to which the paint is applied yeah and then you can abstract the paint away and i mean fashion in general just magnify the characteristics that are appealing to the opposite sex because war pain is probably you know it is you're magnifying the characteristics that are appealing to you the other sex so ability to gain resources maintain resources is um status status and the hierarchy all those kinds of things well but well that's that's part of it but i think another part has to do with in in that case male coalitions so we we were intense this is another unique characteristic i don't know if you got into this with richard rang i don't remember you talking about this but he's written a lot about male coalitionary psychology and humans cooperate uh to an extraordinary degree forming coalitions for the purpose of competing with rival coalitions and so you even see this with um well you see it in the sports sports arenas with with team sports you know where this team wears a different uniform than that team uh they have different mascot etc and so part of that is um male coalitionary psychology well you so you write again returning to the textbook now people should know you wrote a lot of incredible book that is maybe more accessible than the evolutionary psychology textbook but uh oh so the the evolutionary psychology textbook is very accessible yes it is extremely accessible but that's not your thing and on amazon you can't you know it's a pain it's a textbook it's not you know it's it's a little bit more of a pain to purchase which i did i bought all your books they're amazing uh we'll talk about a bunch of them but in terms of coalitions in chapter 12 of your evolutionary psychology textbook you write about status prestige and social dominance so how do hierarchies of status and social dominance emerge in human society and what's the value of status and sexual selection we talked about uh cues of individual health and all that kind of stuff but what the heck's the purpose of status why why does it matter if i'm the big boss well uh it matters because status is influences your access to resources and your ability to influence other people within your within your group and so um this is part of the reason why women prioritize a man's social status uh how he is viewed in the eyes of others because high status men have access to to more resources it's interesting that you ask about that because um i've just published this is with patrick durkee a former graduate student of mine we published a couple papers on precisely this issue where we looked at what we call human status criteria that is what are the things that lead to increases or decreases in status and we did this in 14 different cultures and we found some things that are universal but also some things that are sex differentiated and so universal things like people value trustworthiness they value um intelligence wisdom knowledge so it's even if you go across cultures uh even to the small-scale cultures that we alluded to earlier uh there are these wise wise people wise men and wise women in the culture who have uh people go to for advice for wisdom and so having a wide range of knowledge is is a universal status criterion and there's some things that are sex differentiated and they often fall into the mating domain as well this is where mating and status are interestingly related to each other in that um successful mating increases your status but having high status also gives you access to more desirable mates um and so the game gets harder and harder always so wait uh so are we talking about what are the characters what what's the role of power and wealth those kinds of things so you said wisdom is universal yeah what about wealth and power yeah well uh well um i guess it depends on what you mean by power so i think of power as the ability to to influence a large number of people yeah so um and this is one of the interesting things about the fact that cash economies are so are evolutionarily very recent in that we're people are like so so i guess recently or it's about to happen uh that um elon musk is gonna buy a okay where to say it happen is it happening already yeah okay so they said like the the wealthiest or one of the wealthiest men on earth has now purchased the most influential media platform uh on earth and so obviously you or i couldn't um compete with elon musk and uh for the purchase of twitter and so uh the fact that that cash economies allow the stockpiling of unprecedented amounts of wealth produces these tremendous power differentials that that didn't exist in in over most of human evolutionary history so their wealth is power but you can also be um the power can be attained through other ways yeah but but but i would say that the interesting thing about wealth is that it's an infinitely fungible resource so you can use it and translate it into many many other things like buying a buying twitter or buying a big house or or even getting mates or an artificial um in the i don't know if you don't want to get into that at all but i need to have these sex dolls or virtual virtual reality sex that some people are are developing if you have enough resources you can purchase things like that so you can trans you can translate wealth into a variety of other tangible things in ways that that you couldn't ancestrally so that's one really powerful thing but there is still power that's correlated but not intricately connected to what wealth which is like being leaders of nations like technically the president of the united states salary is not very high right presidents and and then you look you go outside of that into the half of the world that's living under authoritarian regimes you have dictators and there's uh those those are very powerful usually men uh and presumably there's some value there in the meeting selection aspect yeah yeah absolutely and and it's not by chance that um most of them are men um and this is gonna sound strange or and hopefully not offensive to people but um if you ask the question why are why is it the case that men are in positions of power so much more so than than women well in part it can be traced to women's mate preferences so it's one of the sex differences that women have over revolutionary time preferred men who had power status resources etc and what that has done is it's created selection pressure on men to attach a high motivational priority to clawing their way up the status hierarchy um and and uh studies of uh time allocation distribution show this where men are they're more willing to sacrifice their their friends their grandmother their kin or whatever to claw their way up to the top of status hierarchies women much less women spend more effort maintaining relationships with their kin through their friends their friend networks and so forth and so um and and so in a way uh so you could say not only are you uh not only are men in positions of power more than women now you're blaming women for why they are and it's not it's not a matter of blame but i think that that what i just outlined is is an essential part of the causal process the co-evolution of women's mate preferences with men's motivational priorities how much do you think these mating strategies underlie all of human civilization like what motivates us uh you know there's uh uh becker with the denial of death like what why do we build castles and bridges and rockets and the internet and all of this is it some complex mush or is it underneath at all are we all just trying to get laid uh well i wouldn't reduce it to something quite as trying to get laid um but i think i think mating is is is certainly part of it um i wonder how big of a part because also with with uh ernest becker the idea is that we're all trying to achieve an illusion of immortality yeah so we're trying to create something that outlasts us and therefore we create bigger and bigger things in societies and bridges and yeah well i think what's what's missing from becker's analysis is uh you know i mean it's it's it's a fascinating book to read denial of death but what's missing is that i think that the reason that and and again i think it's more men than women i think there's a sex difference on this that men want to build a a lasting legacy because that will in turn affect their lineage and uh although i i do now woody allen is out of favor but i remember this quote from him he said he said he didn't want to achieve immortality through his work he wanted to achieve immortality by not dying oh boy the the funny ones are also uh deeply flawed often staying on the topic of sex differences in a very different way perhaps so dominance and submissiveness something you've also written about what's the role of that inside relationships about this human dynamic of dominance and submissiveness is that a feature or a bug so the the stable state that these dynamical systems arrive at uh is it good to have an equality within a relationship or is it good to have differences in a relationship uh are you talking about romantic relationships or just in human relationships romantic probably because unless it could be generalized to human relationships perhaps it could be generalized to human relationships i wasn't thinking that but perhaps it could be but let's start with romantic i guess one-on-one i'm personally in favor of uh equality uh on that dimension within romantic relationships and um in the in i don't talk about my personal life uh but um but i've been in relationships uh and the best ones tend to be those where where there's uh equality and one person does not uh dominate the other um but i guess what i was the reason i asked you is in what type of relationships because there are some things like coalitions where hierarchy is very important to the function of the coalition so it's like you if you're like a war coalition or something in small group warfare you can't just have equality you have to have um leaders that are determining the um the battle plan so to speak um and so if you have uh you you're you're attacking a neighboring group or something and everyone gets an equal say it's not gonna work that way and so we tend to appoint as leaders those who are just not always work out well but those who are presumably wise or good effective leaders and even talk about and i'm sure you're familiar with this and i'm not an expert on this but you know wartime leaders versus peacetime leaders and so again it depends on you know what the goal is of the group that you are a part of um and so and so i think there is functionality and utility to a lot of our evol psychology of status and dominance and submissiveness so for example and you have to look at the individual psychology and this is actually something i'm currently studying um again with with patrick durkee where one advantage of these status hierarchies is that you're not always battling you know so you determine um and that's why here's another sexually dimorphic aspect of our psychology formidability assessment so there's there's evidence that males engage in this you know can i take this guy or can he take me like and it's like it's the entirety of my life yes it's like a spontaneous assessment of of formidability and and it also the that information is critical because that means like who you should not challenge or or who you can challenge with impunity impunity so um and and there's functionality to submitting uh as well you know because you you defer to someone so that you don't get vanquished and you live to see another day uh so i think we actually have a very rich psychology of status hierarchies and dominance and submissiveness so especially sort of uh violent conflict yes but back to relationships so maybe phrased another way what is masculinity what is femininity is there value inside of a relationship for den for differences you talked about meetings meeting strategies with the dating stage where you're selecting the mate but also within you know mating broadly defined as the entirety of the process are should those differences be magnified and celebrated or um sort of suppressed i've seen enough different relationships work and i've seen enough relationships implode to say there's no there's not one size fits all on on these things so even with respect to masculinity and femininity some reduce it psychologically to two other terms which are agency and communion so where agency is you know are you instrumental goal oriented um get tasks done et cetera communion is you know more the the love and forming connections with other people and so forth um and i published a study a while back on uh on what's called unmitigated agency and unmitigated communion so you there are like good and bad aspects of agency and communion so they can go so there's toxic as they say masculinity toxic femininity you can just rephrase that saying there could be toxic agency and toxic communion yeah yeah and so and so some elements of masculinity uh the unmitigated masculinity is uh i think terrible i was actually walking around downtown austin earlier today there's this example and this guy um was um i guess stuck and wanted the car ahead of him to move and all of a sudden he screamed out of who's gonna move your fucking car like and and then jumped out of his car and to a push to me that's that's um toxic masculinity if you will we don't need that you know yeah so in this by the way as somebody who worked with cars quite a long time in terms of human interaction with semi-autonomous vehicles it's so fascinating how the car and traffic brings out like the worst in human nature in a sense or maybe to rephrase that it maybe challenges you to explore something that uh in terms of temper in terms of anger in terms of anxiety that you have been bottling it up there's something that where the car is like a vessel for a psychological experiment of how much stress you can take and some people that stress is like heating uh it's making the water boil and it's fascinating to see what that results in i think if you are the kind of person that explodes emotionally in traffic that means there's deeper issues to sort of confront and it seems like the traffic and the car is a place where you get to confront your the shadow call young shadow there's something deep within that that we don't often fish we're alone with ourselves and we get to see who we truly are yeah well we're yeah it can bring out road rage and also there's this um i don't know when you're in the vehicle there's you have this shell around you and so there's this feeling that you are protected from yes so you could be yourself you could be your true self in this moment and sometimes that true self in this moment is an angry screaming person which means you have you have to introspect that shadow shine a light let me ask you about something that's ongoing currently it'd be fascinating to get your opinion on so um something i've been watching some of the world has been watching is the defamation trial brought by johnny depp against amber hurt have you gotten a chance to watch any of it um i haven't watched it but i've read some reports of it what's your analysis on this particular dynamic we talked about toxicity in the space of agency and communion what do you make of this this relationship that's presented to the world in its raw form you know i don't have strong opinions on it i think in the this stage in the trial we've heard from him primarily we have not and we should say for people listening in case this is published a little bit later we have not heard from amber heard right uh in the world if we heard from heard we're doing that that's going to be happening this week i i don't know i think that i've seen and this is another topic that i have studied is intimate partner violence and some of the nastier um stuff that goes on within relationships and i think that um when this nasty stuff happens sometimes sometimes it's asymmetrical but sometimes it's symmetrical in the sense that they get into these downward spirals where one is insulting the other or even with physical violence one starts pushing the other showing how they're hitting the other and then the other hits back as you get into these um cycles and so uh coming at one point in time you know in this case of uh johnny depp and amber heard you know uh years later and trying to disentangle what actually went on in their relationship um i i don't i don't feel qualified even to do that well it's fascinating to see so first i mean i have a lot of opinions um particularly because i'm just a um a fan of johnny depp as a person a fan of giant depth the actor and the kind of characters he created the person because maybe this is fiction maybe this is reality but they tend to rhyme and uh mirror each other but his fascination with hunter s thompson and there's some aspect of him taking on the hunters thompson personality there's just layers upon layers of wit and humor and it's and also anxiety and darkness with the drug use and all that kind of stuff it's very human very real person and so you get to one of the beautiful things about this trial is you get to basically have a long-form podcast and you get to reveal the complexity of this human the humor under pressure under uh under stress but also just the rawness of love the things that love makes you do or whatever that is what you know whatever the things that keeps us in relationships that are toxic in that turmoil the hope the um the self-delusion the the the push and pull of longing and um fights yeah and that the ups and downs whatever yeah the roller coaster the roller coaster the the the makeup sex yeah exactly you know yeah is it in the questions arise whether that's the feature or a bug like why do we why are we drawn to that you mentioned in mate selection for long-term made selection um i think you said women but i think maybe both uh don't want a kind of you had scientific and eloquent words to use but basically basically crazy people you did yeah so um uh but here it seems like maybe maybe we're drawn to that still yeah rise to the light right well it can be addictive but um it's not good for long-term relationships i mean that characteristic and it and there there is a stable personality characteristic it goes under different names anxiety neuroticism emotional lability et cetera but that's the single personality characteristic that's that is most predictive of breakups and divorces um and and in studies that i've done predictive of conflict in couples people who are emotionally unstable they just get into a lot of conflict with their partner they create create havoc um so um and they now they can be exciting but bad for long-term happiness they seek conflict in order to uh to attain intimacy so conflict creates a creates attention yeah and like like if you take intimacy broadly it it's it's intimate well you're like raw fragile you're right there yeah well and i mean there's one hypothesis that was put forward by um an israeli biologist named amos amos zahavi called uh the the testing of a bond and so he asked the question like why do people inflict costs on their part even like kissing you're you're introducing you know it's a disease vector you know why do people do these weird things um inflicting costs or emotional liability is a way of inflicting costs and what he argues is it's the testing of a bond if the person's willing to tolerate you know this level of stress this level of cost imposition then that means they must be very committed to me and so and i think that's something people do in romantic relationships is they they do test the strength of the bond they they test the the commitment of the person and i think it's i think that's a feature not a bug in the in the sense that um you especially in the early stages of love romantic love we tend to overly romanticize and i idealize our partner so when there's an absence of evidence we we impute positive values and what you this is one of my recommendations to peop friends that i know is is if you're really considering a good long-term commitment to this person go on vacation with them ideally too ideally to a a foreign country where both of you are unfamiliar oh i love it road trip or something like that yeah so where where you you experience unexpected things stresses you get a flat tire or whatever and you encounter and you see how the person deals with stress and you see how you deal with each other under stress and i think that that's um unless you have put stress tests on relationships you really don't know where things stand yeah that's a beautiful way to put it i'm a huge fan of that like road trip and not just late in a relationship like day one yeah road trip not day one day negative one before it even happens to see stress test uh because it makes everybody better it creates intimacy or creates it it it creates or destroys but you know on on the johnny dep so they they also they both suffered childhood abuse the one one of the things that i i took away from the trial for me it was just educational i don't get to see uh inside as most of us maybe don't like toxic relationships or fights and so on a lot of things that people maybe do inside relationships and we don't get to see it present in such a raw way so well one of the things i learned is that you know in terms of partner violence a woman too can be violent yeah absolutely that to me so emotionally and physically violent that um [Music] yeah i almost don't want to uh you know amber heard i mean there's there's no limit to my dislike for that that person in particular uh because um because clearly to me at least i stand with johnny depp to me that guy is full of love and uh but full of demons because he's drawn to whatever the chaos that's created there but also it's just an education for me that i i tend to associate sort of men with violence and toxicity and destruction inside relationships but it was interesting to see that women too can be like directly violent yeah and men too which was also surprising to me have the capacity to stay in such a relationship and to not walk away which is what i thought as my in terms of toxic violent relationships i thought there's a male figure who will do emotional and physical mostly physical violence and then kind of manipulate the mind of the female to stay in the relationship but that dynamic goes but it can go both ways yeah it does go both ways and and i think even the emotional abuse is sometimes even worse than the physical abuse i mean you see that in in studies of uh even like childhood abuse where it's the emotional abuse that is the most damaging what about the role of jealousy something you also written about in a relationship is uh is that a feature a bug you cut you started to speak about it but is is it good to be uh jealous of your partner inside of a relationship how does it go wrong the pros and cons so uh so i've written a whole book on this uh called the dangerous passion um why jealousy is as necessary as sex and love um and i think that one cut at your question is that um a moderate so first of all i think it's it's a feature not a bug in in most cases so in the in the sense that you you have to have an adaptation that is sensitive to threats to a valued relationship okay because and i think i alluded to this earlier that just because you're in a relationship and you're in a relationship with a desirable partner doesn't mean that you know you've finished solving the problems of mating that you need to solve because there are threats from the outside so mate poachers people who try to lure your partner away for either a sexual encounter or a more committed romantic relationship and then there's also dissatisfaction within the relationship so your partner might become tempted to be sexually unfaithful or romantically unfaithful or emotionally unfaithful and so and so we need humans with the evolution of long-term pair bonding we need adaptations to guard the relationship and be sensitive to threats to the relationship and i think jealousy is one of those i think that's it's a key one and now um that i think that uh there are a variety of benefits to it but also a variety of costs or downsides to jealousy because we know that jealousy male sexual jealousy is the leading cause of spousal abuse and spousal violence physical physical violence probably emotional violence as well or psychological violence uh and so that's why i call it the dangerous passion it's it's it's a necessary emotion but it is also a dangerous emotion um leads to homicide um you know leads to uh and i've studied also homicidal ideation uh which is intersects with this topic in that um men sometimes women to a lesser degree develop homicidal ideation about people who are trying to poach their mates or who do poach their mates successfully poach their mates so what jealousy does is it is it alerts you to a threat to the relationship and it motivates um checking out the source of the threat how threatening is this so i think people tend to increase vigilance of their partner in the modern world that includes you know hacking into their cell phone or computer monitoring them um uh sometimes stalking them but also can include positive things so it might be that so one trigger of jealousy is is is a direct threat to the relation but there's another more subtle trigger of jealousy which is a mate value discrepancy so usually when people mate there's they they assort or pair up on overall mate values so the in the american 10 point scale the eights tend to pair up with the eighths the sixes with the sixes the tens with the tens and the ones with the ones american is their other out of the scales uh i i wonder if the miracle systems well there's a binary i just find it zero one sorry but okay i know yeah the eighth pair is where they age seven yeah yeah so in general but there are errors in mate selection you kind of alluded to the that issue earlier that sometimes people make errors errors in mate selection which they do so sometimes you think this person is well matched on mate value but they're not but then things change so a let's say uh they're the same you have two sixes and then all of a sudden the woman's career takes off all of a sudden she's you know uh getting promotion she's uh uh acquiring wealth she's attracting men who are of a different mate value than she previously did well that triggers jealousy in the guy even if she swears she's going to be totally loyal and she has no signs of leaving or no signs of infidelity a mate value discrepancy is going to trigger jealousy now what can it do well it can do in the broadest sense people can do two classes of things they can do cost inflecting things or benefit providing things so the the man in that situation might say okay i need to devote more attention to my partner i need to up my game when it comes to resource acquisition i need to lavish more attention and gifts on her and so there's a whole suite of benefit provisioning things that can help to reduce that mate value discrepancy and then there's al also cost inflicting things that and and and humans unfortunately do both both sets of things yeah i there's also this uh maybe that's love i notice um the people i especially love or have a connection to romantically or otherwise there's a feeling like i don't deserve you so with friends with so on like i mean i tend to think that about almost everything which is why it's a strong signal when i don't feel it that way which is like i can't i'm how lucky am i to have this uh and that's a good that's a that's a weird illusion of inflation of value or something like uh i think that the positive effect of that is makes what motivates me to be better i guess on this 110 skill to be higher and you sort of kind of have to either like it's a nice feature that your mind sees others that you have affection towards as higher value and it forces you to have that like i i'm a person that experiences jealousy and that forces me to be better yeah i get my shit together yeah well and i think that the the um sometimes the best relationships are when both people feel lucky to be with the other person yes exactly it's balanced that way and then that's when you in terms of jobs in terms of going to the gym all those kinds of things and um yeah so a little bit of jealousy i have discussion with those people i always wonder there's people in relationships where like no no they're there's no they never experience jealousy i wonder what that's like because they're very successful relationships but and i always wonder you know i'm currently single so i always doubt that i know what the hell i'm doing at all uh but i i'm definitely somebody that experiences jealousy and kind of enjoys jealousy um like a little bit of like missing to me that's like you're missing the other person yeah well longing for the other person and here's another uh interesting wrinkle that i also talk about in the book is sometimes people intentionally evoke jealousy in their partner and i think that's also a kind of testing of a bond uh kind of issue yeah so and especially women but i think both sexes interpret a total absence of jealousy as a sign that their partner is not sufficiently committed to them or sufficiently in love with them so if you like to say i don't know if you you go to a party with your partner and then you leave the room for some reason you come back and your partner is passionately kissing someone else and doesn't bother you at all that might be a cue to the partner that well maybe you're not very in love with that person or not very committed to them and so it's a good way to it's a good way to test that said i mean i love the term mate poaching by the way i believe here in texas mate poaching is officially illegal so one of my favorite songs by hendrix says hey joe um hey joe where you going with that gun in your hand yeah and yeah i actually i always wanted to play that song but i get uh i start to think about guns and so on i think it's supposed to capture a feeling it's not actual violence it's saying i'm going to shoot my old lady i caught her messing around with another man that's uh that's a blues type of feeling like of anger of um i guess from mate poaching for uh mate switching performed by the partner and then the uh the frustration and the anger that's resulting that i always wondered why the violence is directed towards the partner versus the person who did the yeah it's the other male tends to be evenly split um so sometimes and that's i mean men especially uh when someone poaches on their mate they have homicidal fantasies which well equally specific towards the mate poacher yeah but but he but equally split so so it's uh um i think the the non-lethal violence uh tends to be more directed toward the mate because it's it's and this is a horrible thing of male sexual psychology but i think part of the violence is functional in the sense that it's designed to keep a mate and prevent her from engaging in anything with um with other with other potential mate poachers but um but people do uh it's so even it says it goes back uh like to the french law where they had the uh so-called crime of passion so if the husband walked in and found uh his wife having sex with some other guy in bed and shot him that was viewed as a crime of passion it's still not legal but you get kind of get a discount yeah for it whereas if he if he goes home thinks about it for a while then gets the gun comes back then that's premeditated murder yeah see to me i guess everybody's different to me i have zero anger towards the partner on that situation to me because that's definitive proof of disability so like why what's the what's the function of the anger there yeah to me uh all of my anger is towards the the guy the poacher right because some of it has to do probably with the status establishing like it's uh what was the term you use the formidability yeah formidability assessment assessment and i'm like wait wait wait did you just say you're more formidable than me in this situation i want to reestablish at least in my own mind the formidability and and that seems to be i guess we're all different but maybe because i roll around with guys a lot like grappling wrestling all that kind of stuff to me to establish status it's competing with other males not with the female because that that's a break of loyalty like why do what's this what's the point of anger at this point that's just betrayal well except that a lot of it uh a lot of the mate poaching is is discovered or accused to make pushings are discovered before the consummation of the act so it might be just like the emotional cheating leader or of mild flirtation sure you know things like that and so the violence is is um designed to head off the threat before it becomes real boy aren't human relations especially romantic ones complicated so uh but that's what makes them so fascinating to study and so fun yes exactly from a science perspective and to study from within sort of uh uh was like richard rangham with the champs like um you know be in it study from the end of one perspective uh what do you make of polyamory um so what what the heck is what do you make of marriage what are your thoughts about marriage what are your thoughts about lifelong monogamy and what's your thoughts about polyamory given that we've been talking about ideas of mate switching and poaching and all that kind of stuff yeah i think that we evolved to be i prefer the term a pair bonded species so pair bonding is one of the strategies purebond long-term mating is one of the strategies but that doesn't necessarily mean for decades and decades or life long because we often pair bond serially so get into a relationship that might last a year or five years and then break up and then form another relationship so we engage in serial mating we engage in infidelity we engaged in we engage in some short-term mating and so we have a what i describe as a menu of mating strategies and which particular mating strategy an individual adopts depends on a wide variety of factors it i think some are just kind of personal proclivities some depend on your mate value so if you are an eight to nine or a ten you have more options for what mating strategy you want to pursue if you're a one or a two you're not going to be able to be polyamorous uh in in all likelihood um there's a lot of attention to polyamory now uh and uh it's unclear whether this whether there's an increase in it or whether people are just talking about it more it is the case and i know i know several people who are in polyamorous relationships and i've talked with them in detail about them and jealousy is often a factor in that and they describe it as kind of like um uh an emotion that has to be somehow tamed or dealt with in in some way and so and so in polyamory there are many different types of polyamory so in like one type for example is you have a primary love partner and then some others on the side that are permitted usually within in consensual terms within a an explicit contract that the cup that the primary partners work out so it's okay if you you know i know as one couple it's okay if you do it outside the city limits of los angeles but not within some say it's okay for thursday but i want the weekend friday and saturday nights to me it's okay if there's sexual involvement but no emotional involvement so there are different type different strategies that people work out and some of them are designed to try to keep jealousy at bay so i think it's an evolved emotion there's a natural emotion that that people experience um now interestingly there's there's a while we're on this topic there's a sex difference therein um uh namely if you contrast sexual jealousy with emotional jealousy or sexual infidelity with emotional infidelity and so we we in one set of studies i put my participants or we used to call them subjects um into this what i call the sophie's choice of the jealousy dilemmas i said imagine your partner became interested in someone else and you discover that they have had passionate sexual intercourse with this person and they've gotten emotionally involved with them they've fallen in love with them which aspect of the infidelity upsets you more and when you and that's why it's called the sophie's shirts both terrible choices yeah uh but men much more likely to say the sexual infidelity is what upsets me more women it's like why even ask me it's a no-brainer 85 percent of women say the emotional infidelity is what bothers me more former student of mine uh barry cooley did a really interesting study of uh analysis of this reality show called cheaters i've actually never seen it but where where if you suspect your partner of cheating then the detective from the tv team will follow the person uh and then they'll call up and say we've just seen you found your husband here in the no-tell motel do you want to come down and talk to him and so the and so what he analyzed though was the verbal interrogations that people had when they confronted their partner and women wanted to know are you in love with her men wanted to know did you fuck him or did you have sex with them and so is it's this sex difference in sensitivity to these different cues of infidelity and and of course there's there's an evolutionary logic to this to this sex difference and it's been replicated not not the cheater study but um the hypothetical sophie's choice studies been replicated now in sweden and china and you know it's a universal sex difference so given that sex difference and you mentioned another one that just returned to which is uh in the engineering disciplines yeah person thing or presentation so until i started to see writing about in the sort of psychology literature i observed this anecdotally a lot and the reason i observed it is i was confused so i care a lot about robots i'm a robotics person and so a lot of males in the robotics community really didn't care about the what's called the human robot interaction problem which is like robots when they interact with humans and then a lot of females all brilliant in in the robotics community cared about the human robot interaction they cared about the human the what the robot colleague communicates with the human in the picture human in the loop and i was really confused like because the difference to me in my anecdotal interactions but the the n is quite large there like i you know i'm in the robotics community i know a lot of people yeah and i was confused because for me i really care about human robot interaction i i see i care about both a lot and in the same thing here in terms of emotional cheating versus physical cheating i care a lot about both and i have like this oscillating brain so i wonder what that says about my brain so i often wonder this because there's specific sex differences that are represented in the data in the literature and i seem to oscillate depending on mood yeah and i wonder what that says about me why do i care so much about that robot on the floor i care not uh half i care about how it works and the other half how makes other people feel yeah what is that yeah so so i guess what i would say this gets back to our earlier discussion of agency and communion where i actually think that it's a sign of being well balanced to have both capacities uh within use and so you get people who are um unimodal or do they just have one mode of operating let's say it's the thing mode which which engineers tend to be good at you know you have to be good at it to be a good engineer because things have to actually work yes you know it's not in some you know dream or hypothetical state things have to have to actually work but with the agency and communion i think it's good to have a balance and that's why i think some of the best romantic relationships are those where people are they're high on what they used to call androgyny where they have both the positive features of agency and communion the positive features of masculinity and femininity uh within the same mix but also with the footnote of not the unmitigated agency or unmitigated communion both of which can be negative and so i view these as um capacities and some people are out of balance some people have a good balance between the two it sounds like you have a good balance between the two well but also the allocation i feel like it's a very dynamic thing it's like uh um um at least that where for me personally of the beauty between humans of the dance of the push and pull of the different moods it's like a dynamical system it's not two static entities fully represented and consistent through every interaction sometimes you know um people might confuse the fact that i often talk about love and i i love humans that i don't have a temper that i don't have like i lose my shit all the time especially like on things i really am passionate about like people i work with and so on yeah i'm all over the place and there's but underneath it there's a deep love and respect for humans but like i lose my shit all the time um and that that chaos that roller coaster i think that's what makes human relations awesome i mean that the the push and pull of it of course it can oscillate too far which is when it becomes a herd type of situation when it turns to emotional or physical violence when it turns to jealousy crosses a a line where it's hurtful and there's like that it crosses that vast gray landscape of what is abuse uh versus what is just a beautiful term of human nature right yes yeah and it's it's complicated it's uh yeah yeah it's complicated and it's it's dynamic and i would just add i thought you phrased that brilliantly um but i would just add to that it also depends on sort of what you're trying to do and so i think some of the oscillation can be what task what problem you're trying to solve and so if you're i don't know trying to you know build a bridge or something you need to be very thin oriented and uh you know make sure the damn thing actually works and doesn't collapse when a car goes over it um uh if you're trying to form a relationship um you know and you're entirely thing-oriented it's not going to work you know and that's that's one of the people one of the things that with and males tend to be more on this on the so-called spectrum uh side of things where one of the hallmarks is a deficit in social mind reading just to add to your point about i guess i've already made it that of the dynamic properties of the roller coaster is depending on what problem you're trying to solve you might want to toggle back and forth to one pole or the other you wrote a book called why women have sex understanding sexual motivations from adventure to revenge that sounds fun and everything in between so why do women have sex well i co-wrote it with the female this who's cindy meston a wonderful friend and colleague and coco author and co-collaborator um i wouldn't be presumptuous enough to write a book called why women have sex by myself as as as you can contribute anything to this book i'm just kidding i i did but i have to tell you a story about the um the origins of this idea uh which i give credit to cindy meston for um and we were we would she's a colleague in in the psychology department with me and we would go out to dinner once a week or so and and we were just talking about that she raised this issue and so we started to brainstorm originally it was why humans have sex that's the the scientific article we published was why humans because we're interested in males and females and so i said um i would come well uh they have sex because of x and then cindy maestrom would come up she'd say oh here are seven other reasons and that i'd come up with one more she came up with another seventh so it was like you know so so she's in in some sense importantly the um you know originator or fountain of this of this idea but oh so she's able there's something about the way she thinks about sexuality that's able to deeply introspect about reasons for sex yeah and probably especially about female sexuality and this is one of the interesting things and why it's so fun for me to collaborate with with in this case female because they do have a different sexual psychology than males and so and i've noticed this that's why in my graduate society like i've had 30 or so phd students about half of them male half of them female and the the the women come up with different questions different scientific questions that i wouldn't have thought of necessarily um and so um and so anyway so it turned out to be the collaboration i will i will say that we we co-wrote it and that i did contribute to it and uh especially the the um the evolutionary insights so is there a good few words you can say uh to why women have sex what are some primary motivations well we we originally came up with a list of 237 reasons uh for why uh why humans have sex and they range from you know some of the obvious ones because it feels good uh because i wanted to relieve stress uh be to relieve menstrual cramps to get rid of a headache uh to get my boyfriend off my back so i could get some work done yep um so things like that too to others like um there's another one uh so that he'd take out the damn garbage yeah but another one it was kind of interesting that uh someone one nomination was uh to get closer to god so this there were some that were kind of spiritual spiritual motivations for having sex and then some of the nastier ones like to get revenge on my you know on my partner or to get revenge on arrival so that's sleeping with my you know rivals boyfriend you know so there's some nasty stuff and some good stuff in there it's so fascinating because yeah sex has such a powerful role in our psychology but also in our culture so you can make significant statements about the in the status hierarchy uh about your sex the selection of your sexual partner it's interesting so it's not just because you're horny it's all those other kinds of things yeah mornings is one but there are there are other reasons what about different kinds of sex so you know what's uh again this is not the human lab podcast rough sex versus quote making love what's the explanation between all of that all the various king now that's just a basic sort of split but all the different kinks that humans establish all the different fantasies and all those kind of yeah yeah well that's a complicated question um for for which i don't think we have uh sufficient time to get into that you know in detail and and it is complicated because there are some sexual fantasies that uh sexual fantasies by the way i think a really fascinating window into our sexual psychology because in a way they're they're unconstrained by you know things like rules and norms in society and cultural presses that you're kind of free to fantasize about whatever you want to fantasize about so i think it's it provides an interesting window into human sexuality uh and there are some predictable ones and then there are some also individual or idiosyncratic ones and and um the again the there's a fundamental sex difference in in this in that uh when you talk about like fetishes or like shoe fetishes leather fetishes different types of um things males are much more prone to those than females you've had as you said almost all fetishes males are overrepresented and i think it's partly because there's some evidence that they're classically conditioned so i think that first or early sexual experiences that people have kind of condition them to the cues that are present during those early ones and so if your first sexual experience happened to be you know um involve visual images of shoes or you're having to look in your shoes when you first had sex it's just an example or leather or zippers or whatever the case is that people develop these very individualistic um sexual turn-ons based on these early sexual experiences uh so it could also be you said have sex but it could also be sexual feelings early sexual feelings like because it yeah um so i wonder what that is about men that they have a more when they first start experiencing sexual feelings that they're more sensitive to the cues and those cues somehow have a deep psychological effect on their development of their sexuality so if they have kinks that means they're somehow more q sensitive and maybe does it matter if society like slaps them on the wrist for it does that help solidify the kinks yeah i don't know about the society's slack on the wrist but i think what it is is this i think this is the evolutionary uh hypothesis anyway about why there's this sex difference and that is that men are conditioned to anything that's going to lead to sex because uh whereas women don't have to be uh from male perspective because of women's greater investment because the nine-month pregnancy etc in order to reproduce women have to invest this tremendous amount uh men don't one act of sex can produce an offspring and so uh for men but not for women and so this huge asymmetry and investment means that the payoff matrix of different sexual strategies differs for the sexes in that context women become the valuable and scarce resource over which men compete so anything that leads to successful sex is going to be selected for and so men are very sensitive to being sexually conditioned that's what's called sexual conditioning to whatever cues are associated with sex happening um from a woman's perspective sex is not a um a scarce resource so a woman could go out here in austin any night or probably any day on sixth street and have no problem having sex uh with a guy within 10 minutes okay guy would have more difficulty um he's not gonna go out you know unless he's unless he's johnny depper really really charming yeah yeah that's a fascinating dimorphism or asymmetry in in our um made selection what do you think is the effect on this young male brain a female 2 of pornography so one of the fascinating things that the digital world brought us now i i grew up at a time when like a magazine like a victoria's secret magazine was like my source of um sexual inspiration uh but that was so that was before the internet and now the internet with pornography makes it extremely accessible all kinds of kinks all kinds of wild variety i mean variety and quantity is immense so what do you think that has how that affects mate selection mating and just the human psychology of the of the of the two sexes of the species yeah great question a big question uh so i mean we could have a whole podcast just on that or at least talk for a while about it so i'll just say a couple of things uh about that one is again there's a sex difference then i feel like i'm a broken record here hammering on this but uh it is a lot of just to actually echo the thing please be a broken record because it's it's interesting the more we get to the mating the more there's sex differences represent themselves they serve yes yeah that's right and in many psychological domains there are no sex differences or the sexes are very similar but pornography is consumed about 80 percent of the consumers are men so it is very heavily a male consumer industry if you will and i think that it can have positive and negative effects depending on the circumstances so one um potential negative effect is that men might develop unrealistic expectations about what sex will be like or should be like in in real life uh and so and so i remember actually this i just heard about this one case of um i don't mention any names where um a man got married and he had been accustomed to seeing very large breasts in his pornography consumption and discovered that his wife had what he perceived to be very small breasts in fact they were actually just medium size but because he had been so heavily exposed to pornography and the artificially enhanced breast size that is often depicted in pornography that um he had come to expect something that was that was unrealistic in this case um not leading that's not not the way to lead off to a great sex life with your wife by being disappointed in her breast size so i think that people can develop in this case men unrealistic expectations also about the kind of sexual acrobatics that porn stars engage in and when they get in real life situations can put pressure on women to become you know uh to fulfill those those kinds of images um but the other thing the other kind of detrimental effect that it has is and this is something that is emerging culturally is i think it has a dampening effect on men's pursuit of real-life relationships because in some sense it kind of bleeds off some of that sex drive or sexual desire sexual energy um and so they're and some men get addicted to it so they're spending hours and hours and hours a day consuming pornography uh and so i think can have a detrimental effect on even on men's ambition yeah that there's something really powerful about that sexual energy not to be all like spiritual about it but it seems like that's somehow correlated with ambition so like uh one of the things that pornography can take away is like exactly as you said is your pursuit of love out there including women but also love of things meaning like building awesome epic things the love of both bridges and women yeah uh bridge building and and uh and relationship building yeah there's something about that energy and um and also uh yeah there's a sort of a vicious downward spiral because it somehow staunch your development because it limits social interaction that the push and pull of of uh romantic social interaction it cuts the edge off of that and it forces you to be to spend way too much time with yourself without the development of that social interaction yeah i don't know but there so outside of the um the expectations on all those kinds of things it seems to have a detrimental effect on the development of the of the human mind yeah what is that i don't i don't because some of that is echoed and you know people talk about the metaverse that some of our life will be in the digital space and it's like on one hand well if it brings you happiness it brings you joy short term and long term why is the metaverse not the same or better than the real world but there is something still missing and what is that um something of the pleasure you feel with porn is still missing it's really not representing some of the fundamental pleasure you feel when you interact with real people and that could be just the growth you experience like real people can reject you the challenge the the again the push and pull all of that the dance of human relations yeah yeah and the exploration of your sexuality so um on porn you can kind of passively explore because you can see you know as as you mentioned uh a wide variety of things and and and people people do that but in terms of exploring your your own sexuality i think there's no replacement for a real human being so you've written about violence and here we're talking about porn and sex i don't know if you have thoughts on this but i'd love to ask your opinion on quote in cells so here i would like to quote wikipedia that define incels as members of an online subculture of people who define themselves as unable to get a romantic or sexual partner despite desiring one they also write now i don't know if wikipedia is the accurate source of bot in cells but here it is there i quote at least eight mass murders resulting in a total of 61 deaths have been committed since 2014 by men who have either self-identified as as themselves or who had mentioned incel related names and writings in their private writings or internet postings insult communities have been criticized by researchers and the media for being misogynistic encouraging violence spreading extremist views and radicalizing their members is there some insight that you draw from this connection of sex and lack of sex to violence well uh i think sex and violence are linked in in various ways and uh it's it's it's not just it's not just incell so uh uh if you look at um serial killers for example uh and this is another thing that i've i'm true crime is kind of a avocation of mine i just enjoy reading about true crime and following true crime stories application of hobby a hobby side subside interest super fancy word for hobby i got it yeah uh that like ted bundy um he was actually very charming and and didn't have any trouble attracting women but his killing spree started shortly after he was rejected by a very high status attractive woman and he felt a rage about being rejected by her uh now who knows that's an n of one and we don't know if you know you know being rejected um causes serial killing per se but sex and violence are related in in different ways i argue and and i haven't studied the insult community in detail i actually have an incoming graduate student who's going to start in the fall who who has been studying the insults and so he'll have a more informed picture but my attitude is there are ways to improve your mate value if you're having trouble attracting a mate there are ways to improve your mate value because a lot of things that women want in a mate are improvable you know they women want guys who are um compassionate who are understanding who uh are ambitious who who acquire resources etc they're who are physically fit there are things you can do to improve your mate value and so i would say rather than i would encourage in cells or the insulin communities rather than being hostile toward women or being angry at women um just do things to improve your mate value and then you will be more successful at attracting women yeah i mean some of it that's so fascinating so um your student will be studying that there's a um listen i love the internet the internet always wins and there's a fascinating aspect too which is just humor and i um i'm fascinated by seeing the humor whether it's 4chan or reddit and all that kind of stuff or where people maybe will self-identify as in-cells as a joke is it kind of basically representing the fact that you know it's hard to get women this this the struggle the struggle and for women it's hard to get a mate that they you know they're basically jokingly representing the the the challenges the difficulty of the mate selection process that the desirable group is smaller than the entire group that's it and they're joking about it but then it's interesting how quickly humor uh again a dynamical system it can turn into anger and that on the internet is so interesting to watch like how trolling light trolling is humor but it can turn into aggression and i i've just seen it's weird it's weird how this is true on the internet but you also just look at the dark aspects of the 20th century that i've been reading a lot about how kind of light-hearted things turn dark quickly and it's interesting i i don't know what to make of it because uh it's basically sexual frustration that all humans feel it's you know dating in general can turn into anger uh can turn into sophisticated philosophical constructs like uh about how the world works of who really is pulling the strings right and that turns some of the worst crimes committed uh by the nazis for example were by extremely intelligent people that constructed models of how the world works and there's there's something about sexual frustration is one of the really powerful forces that could be a catalyst for constructing such models and once you've done that shit gets a lot more serious and it's no longer joke it's serious but at the same time when you just look from the surface it's kind of jokes yeah it's weird that's interesting points that you're making i i think that there's this is one way in which evolution has built into us um a a feature which is really bad for our overall happiness uh and and that is that it's created desires that can never be fully met you know and that includes in the mating domain so even with people who are successful in attracting you know somewhat desirable mates maybe they want you know giselle bunchen or some you know they desire things that are there women that are higher and may value or uh or a larger number of partners than they can successfully attract and and in a way i mean these serve as evolutions built into these because they're motivational devices they motivate us to try to get what we want but it also makes us miserable or at least unhappy or dissatisfied because there are desires that can never be fulfilled and this is and this is mentioned one more sex difference this desire for sexual variety meaning a variety of different partners is much much greater in men than women um and so that's why even like in in pornography consumption men will like you know go through multiple multiple multiple um images and sex scenes and so forth uh compared compared to what women who consume pornography go through but this desire for sexual variety is is something that makes men miserable because it's something that they can't most men unless you're a a king or a despot or um you know have have a harem it's something that can never be fulfilled in everyday life and so i even think that you know you talk to men who are walking down the city block in austin or new york city or san francisco or wherever and they pass by they could pass by six women and feel a sexual attraction to six different women in one city block you know now and so this is again where evolution has created in this desires that can never be fully met and an evolution well it's useful right and the the hilarious thing that this always up my own mind by just observing people once you get that 10 or that uh beautiful woman that you've been lost you take her for granted move on to the next thing there are classic cases like um i don't know if you you remember this this case but the hugh grant um was with elizabeth hurley who is a gorgeous model and he was caught having sex with a prostitute i think it was in la or whatever he's he's got elizabeth hurley why are you having sex with a prostitute but it's the male desire for sexual variety uh well let me uh do a little bit of a tangent here and ask you about just your work in general in terms of its interaction with the scientific community and with the world at large so many of the ideas you do research on are pretty controversial or at least the topic is controversial somehow maybe you can speak to that but what are your thoughts in the current climate of cancer culture or maybe there's a better term for it that word is like loaded now uh about you doing research in this space that is so sort of uh essential so crucial to understanding human nature how what are the difficulties what are the concerns for you to be able to freely explore yeah i've been doing um research on these things so when you when you combine um sex or sexuality with sex differences with evolution each of these topics are controversial by themselves and you bring them together the intersection becomes especially controversial uh but i uh i guess view myself as a scientist and so um and so i would rather be uh scientifically correct than politically correct uh if you will so i don't i have no interest in i don't have a an agenda i don't have a political agenda i don't have any agenda other than discovering human nature that's what i've devoted my scientific career toward and i'm and that's why i do the studies in responsive to empirical data and and the best theories that we have available the best conceptual tools so do some of these things upset people yeah yeah they do as a matter of fact even early in my career before i started publishing on some of these things i gave a talk in the sociology department this was at university of michigan and a female professor came up to me afterwards and said you know you really shouldn't publish the results of your studies um and i said why not and she said that it would that people women have it hard enough as it is without you know knowing about these things and my view is um my view is that's naive i i think suppression of scientific knowledge is is a bad thing and suppression of scientific knowledge about sex differences is is a bad thing uh men and women are not psychological clones uh especially when it comes to the mating domain and sexuality domain the only the only other domain that shows massive sex differences that we haven't touched on is aggression and violence so the the leading cause of violence is is being a male uh males have a ma and the more extreme the violence the more males have a monopoly on us when you get to homicide warfare may also have a monopoly on it and we need to understand human nature and we need to understand sex differences therein in order to be in a position to effectively solve some of the social problems that these sex differences create um so um you know so i've been uh gotten some flack uh uh no one's tried to cancel me uh in my work so far so i'm i'm i'm just wait yeah just uh yeah but does it hurt you personally just is it is it psychologically difficult you know to do this work because uh what is research is thinking deeply through things and uh um like doing studies but also interpreting them and thinking through what is the right questions to ask what does this mean and for that you have to have a clear mind a um an optimistic mind a free mind and all that so it's you're just a human so psychologically is it difficult does it wear on you yeah um yeah i would say not not really but um i've been i think fortunate so even say my latest book i published a book recently on conflict between the sexes and um and it deals with very controversial topics including intimate partner violence like with the johnny depp amber heard thing and i don't talk about that in the book but um and uh and it's been largely well received you know and i think partly it's because i am careful in my publications not to endorse it so one of the common conflations that people make is they think that uh it's something that you think is good you know that you know um if you find a sex difference that there should be a sex currencies the is odd confusion um and so i try to make it very clear uh that i'm studying what is not what ought to be and a lot of things that i discover about what is the case i would prefer them not to be and i think you kind of alluded to this earlier by saying that we um have to override some of our violent uh inclinations or impulses or uh the way i would phrase it is we have to um control them control or keep quiescent or suppress uh some of the nastier sides of of human nature and and we've successfully done that in some domains so um you can talk about like one group that fascinates me is uh the vikings and the whole that whole um uh uh era and so you have you have in in sweden norway for example uh these are these have like the lowest homicide rates on earth um but you go back 400 years ago 600 years ago people were killing each other right and left you know and so and so finding that uh so this is let leads me to be optimistic that we can um change conditions to suppress our evolved proclivities just like the one one physical example that i sometimes use is callous producing mechanisms we have evolved callus producing mechanisms that are very valuable we develop thickness in the areas of our skin that have experienced repeated friction but we can in principle design environments where we don't experience repeated friction and so we won't grow calluses and so you design an environment that basically prevents the activation of our callus-producing mechanism i think we can do the same thing with some of these other inclinations um and and have succeeded in you know reductions of homicide in even in the last couple hundred years and some of that has to do with the myths and stories we tell ourselves like again it's language because i i mean i love the vikings uh valhalla that idea yeah that's a myth that's an idea that's a promise for the for the great land beyond over there beyond the mountains it's like animal farm sugar caney mountain that is promised to you if you're a great warrior i believe valhalla is where half the soldiers go um as a reward for for great soldiering for being great warriors and the thing i just recently have been reading quite a bit about valhalla which is um it's such a fascinating how the these myths are constructed the i believe i just think this is such an awesome setup in terms of a kind of heaven which is they spend the entire day fighting so they for joy and if they die they're reborn the next day so it's it's you're basically the passion the thing you're passionate about without the consequences on top of that i think there's a pig or a boar that is they keep eating so it's regenerated every single day so unlimited food and there's unlimited beer i believe so it's like it's like or mead yes yes yes yes mead i don't know that's that's fascinating that we construct these myths and at the same time uh these myths can be used to get humans to do some of the worst atrocities so some of the violence requires us to have those myths of what is waiting for us beyond death sort of beyond over there in sugar candy mountain as uh crow says that in animal farm and so you know i think the more and more in this modern society the positive of not constructing so many myths is that we get to live more in the moment and that forces us to optimize and improve the moment and we get to face the irrational and the painful aspect of violence maybe we should reduce that in the here and now yeah the downside is we may not if we dispose of god or these kinds of religious and spiritual ideas we might descend into a you know what nietzsche worried about with nihilism and it's a beautiful dance because humans seem to tie themselves together with narratives yes yeah and with myths and stories that we all believe if you completely dispose of them a society i don't know we don't know we don't know yeah it's going to happen if it's going to collapse or if it's actually going to rediscover better myths better stories more scientifically grounded ones uh ones that are driven in data and all those kinds of things um yeah i i don't know i mean it's an interesting question i mean i don't have any um brilliant insights into it other than that you know to agree with you that people construct narratives uh well of their own lives and sometimes the the life after death um but i guess i would add and this is maybe a more cynical view but you mentioned atrocities i think that leaders can sometimes exploit those under them to create forms of uh violence or justification for um for warfare like in you know the like the the group that we are conquering they are uh sub-human they're they're insects they're an infectious disease that is you know and so these these narratives can be used by leaders to exploit and motivate um people under them to commit these atrocities so it's a nastier part of our psychology both that leaders do that but also that people are vulnerable to narratives of that sort yeah it's fascinating to look pre-internet you hope the internet makes us more resistant to that which i do have probably a question on that but if you look at just the propaganda machines during world war ii on the nazi side and on the soviet side on every side but particularly in those two it's so fascinating both how effective a simple message can be in a leader being able to convince the small inner circle around them uh convince themselves which is fascinating propaganda and you start to believe the propaganda degenerate and then how easily the the populace is convincible again you hope that the internet the distributed nature of the internet makes it more difficult to run a propaganda campaign at least of the classical sort i do have uh a question about this because you mentioned elon musk when we're talking about status hierarchies like you and i can't buy twitter and wealth accumulation yeah what do you think about elon buying twitter um in particular in the reason the state of reason uh that he's doing so in um emphasizing free speech that's an interesting question but i don't really have an informed opinion about it you know i don't know um uh it's not my area of expertise and i don't um i don't know enough details and i also don't know what his plans are for twitter what what changes he plant proposes to implement well the reason i bring that up is because and you you've kind of said you don't necessarily feel a tremendous amount of pressure but in doing controversial research and doing research on controversial topics you're also a communicator and twitter is a platform which you communicate and there's going to be if you get canceled somewhere you get cancelled on twitter yeah and so there's pressure so what does free speech look like in these public platforms it's communicating difficult ideas it's changing your mind is exploring ideas and not fearing the mob the mob that pressures the platform to remove you from the platform or to ban you shadow ban you from the platform decrease your reach artificially on the platform and those are really fascinating questions that we get to deal with in this new digital age so there's a lot of ideas what you said what elon is planning to do forget elon how do you do this well that's the question and uh there's sort of an absolutist view of free speech let anyone say anything and i tend to be a person that believes everybody should have the freedom to say anything the question with a social media platform is well uh can you force anyone to hear what you have to say because the virality the viral nature of communication means that you can control who hears what you say yeah the virality of that the search and discovery aspect and it's i think that's a fascinating question from the algorithmic perspective the amount of data out there just like papers there's a huge amount of papers what you want is to find best papers the ones you agree with but also the ones that challenge you and you don't want to non-stop read the papers that challenge you you're going to be mentally exhausted there's a bucket of attention and focus and mental energy you can allocate the ones that really challenge you the ideas that really challenge you are exhausting it's good just like going to the gym is good but then you also want to read um things that are fun for you and those are you know um if you spend your whole life in arguments that's going to be exhausting you want to hang out chill with your friends watch some netflix have fun whatever easygoing and sometimes have difficult academic arguments with people for example people you disagree with but not all the time you have to have a platform what is free speech actually looks like it's a platform where everybody can challenge anybody but not destroy them by doing so mentally so you have to balance uh personal growth of each individual person on the platform but definitely removing people from a platform is a terrible thing so on top of that it's like how do you get measures that the platform is doing good what i really like what elon said and i've talked to him about this is uh pissing off everybody equally the extremes of every side equally in the political spectrum you could say the left and the right is uh measuring by pissing off the extremes equally because currently there seems to be an asymmetry in that so that's one good measure that allows you to maximize as he says the area under the curve of human happiness uh that's one thing the the other is repres people representing themselves honestly so removing the bots from the platform it's such a weird world we live in where you don't know who's real or not so anonymity is an awesome thing the awesome aspect of anonymity is it protects people's privacy it actually gives them freedom to think freedom to speak even more so but when anonymity is weaponized it allows you to be cruel to others without the repercussion of cruelty that you would feel in the physical world right so you want to use anonymity as a shield versus as a as a sword so to protect yourself from the attacks of others but not as a way to hurt others and those are all really tricky things to figure out and it's not you know not all of it's going to be solved with an edit button which i believe is the most requested twitter feature anyway i think i think it's really um i think this is fascinating not just for people talking about politics which is what everyone seems to care about but also for science for people challenging each other in the scientific domain because i i at least have hope for scientific communication where people can start playing around with different mediums of communication so not just academic papers but just ideas playing with those ideas yeah absolutely especially when you have so evolution psychology well no that even that it can be super high turn turnover rate of importance but you know you have with kovid it seems like the progress of science and scientific debate uh is most powerful in that context if it's done really quickly and it feels like twitter like most most of the best things i've learned about covet and to stay up to date was uh was on twitter it's so exciting to see uh signs happening so so quickly and all kinds of domains there and that that was great but then you step in with labels of what's misinformation you have this kind of conformity seeking labels of what is true and not which is a very unscientific thing to me in the name of protecting the populace the weird it's a weird um impulse that people have which is well here's an organization here's an institution that is a possessive of the truth and everybody else is untrue now a lot of the time maybe majority of the time that institution is going to be correct this consensus consensus is the consensus because it's usually correct but the biggest ideas are going to be against the consensus and certainly that's true in evolutionary psychology where it seems like are we even is the cake even baked yet it feels like there's a lot of turmoil in terms of figuring out human psychology well there's a lot that we don't know i mean if human psychology if if it were a simple thing and we only had you know three or half a dozen psychological adaptations we would have discovered all of them by now it's it's that it's so complex multifaceted multi-mechanism um part that describes human nature that it was what makes it exciting but also the amount that we know is small compared to the amount that we don't know and so that's why you have to approach these things with um with a certain humility and that's why even like in the in the mating and sexuality domain which i've been studying for a number of years i i keep coming across things that i don't know questions that are unanswered um which which is is um makes it exciting from my perspective i mean that's what the joy is of being being a scientist you mentioned i gotta return real quick to uh ted bundy you mentioned you have uh so you you you've written about murder and violence right in a long distant past but the thread runs through your work today who to you is the most fascinating serial killer of of the of the true crime yeah uh things that you've explored i think well ted bundy's way up there uh i think uh charles manson um uh yeah and is another um have you seen on ted bunny because i find him super fascinating have you seen uh there's a lot of movies on him extremely wicked shockingly even and vile it's a retelling of his life from the perspective of his girl long term girlfriend no i have not seen that one which ties together a lot of our conversation so i it's probably my favorite one a lot of people say it's the best movie on ted bondi you should definitely watch it i will uh i recommend it to others but it's from a perspective uh of the relationship and it just one of the really powerful windows into a serial killer that i saw there is that from the perspective of the relationship you can have just this healthy looking relationship yeah there's some fights and so on but the usual dating and all that kind of stuff was all there so all the murders he was doing he had a long term girlfriend throughout all of that and also throughout all of that i'll try not to give away in case you don't know the story throughout all that she stood by aside she refused to believe everything that was happening yeah until until um you know the very end of course it shifts in the very end and that's a fascinating shift of the the breaking of the the illusion but it's really fascinating that you can have those two things that you yeah well i think that part of it is we have these stereotypes that we expect people like serial killers to be these um ugly um drooling creatures that are sort of uh evil all the time uh and so um that's why even like you had um i don't know if this is if i'm remembering this correctly but like stalin who killed you know millions of people apparently like loved his kids and loved his family and people so so we have this part of the complication uh the complexity of human nature and human psychology is we we don't have just this one you know this one property that dictates how we behave in all circumstances yeah the devil is going to be charismatic that's why that's one of the things i've learned about just looking at evil people looking at jeffrey epstein who seemed to have hoodwinked quite a lot of people yes yeah that's another that's another fascinating case yeah i'm not a he wasn't a serial killer but a serial sexual predator and a lot of people i know and respect didn't see the evil yeah and so i never met the guy but it's like are you guys oblivious like what what was there must have been something and from everything i see is purely just charisma it's it's the it's the smoking mirrors yeah that uh he was very charming psychopath yeah but i i think every psychopath to be effective has to be charming yeah the successful ones yeah yeah successful psychopaths oh yeah and that was i mean ted bundy was one he was a good looking guy um intelligent and could turn on the charm and and then had this evil is there something interesting to be said that i think a large percentage of the fan base like i've seen numbers like 80 plus of the fan base for true crime shows is women is there is there some psychology behind that i haven't seen that i'm not aware if a sex difference that i'm not aware of that you should i mean i i've heard that in a lot of places so i wonder if there's some um there's something about troop crime maybe because it's um just just like sexual kinks for for men develop early on for the the cues maybe for women there's the cues of the threat of violence the attentiveness to violence it develops early on and so and therefore fascination with violence well well i think that i mean one thing is that well with serial killers specifically i don't know if this is true of true crime in general but serial killers like you you find like um a lot of people well a lot of women fall in love with them or you know even if they're they're jailed for serial killing and i think one of the features of it is that it it parasitizes or hijacks status mechanisms in that a key cue to status is the attention structure that is the high status people are the people to whom the most people pay the most attention and so serial killers garner a lot of attention and even though for evil deeds um it's still attention so i think that that hijacking of our status allocation adaptations is partly responsible for that is there given the the trajectory of your life you mentioned berkeley and the east coast and michigan you got you got everything is there given the trajectory of your life in geography and in science can you give advice to young folks today high school college thinking about how to make their own trajectory how to make their own way through life that they can be proud of either career or just love life or life yeah well not necessarily on on careers but i can give advice on on the mating you know and i i think it's one of these things where um you know we have requirements in for the courses that students have to take in high school for example and i think there should be a required course on relationships on on mating so not just sex yeah not not not sex at all yeah because i mean most of what's taught is that they teach about sexual health and how not to get an sti and so forth yeah my my teacher uh put a condom on a banana right right but very excited but um how how to select a maid um how do you know if you're in a bad mating relationship uh how to how to get out of a you know a bad mating relationship um i think that um that there's at this point in the science even though there's a lot that we don't know we know enough to at least provide some heuristics or general guide guidelines to things to watch out for so just as a concrete example uh with intimate partner violence uh and this is male to female there are statistical predictors of is this guy does he have an increased probability of beating you up uh and there are things like if he starts to insist on knowing where you are at all times if he starts cutting off your relationships with your friends and your family um so there are these kind of early warning signs and i think women should know about those uh or even things like um that women are most in danger of being killed by an ex during the first three to six months after they've broken up with him you know that that sometimes they think it's you know the guy will say meet with me one one last time and then i won't bother you again um no this is a dangerous time so i think there's some knowledge that we do know that can be used to make informed decisions about our mating lives and i think that should be taught so consider that like take that the the ma the mating strategies the main demanding life seriously yeah yeah absolutely and uh because um you know aside from a small number of people who are totally uninterested in any kind of mating or sexuality and there are a small percentage that fall under that category um we all confront problems of mating how do you you know there's that uh um called the mathematical model like secretary problem marriage problem i don't know if you're familiar but basically you have a it's it's a silly perhaps not uh it's a formalized simplified cueing theory type of thing where it's you have and and subjects and you get to date some number of um people and then there's a stopping condition i believe it's n over e beyond which you pick the next partner which is better than anybody you've dated before so uh yeah let's not over emphasize that idea but um if i were to psychologize it i would say that some exploration is good some dating is good but at a certain point you pick somebody given the set of people you've explored you pick somebody who is uh pretty desirable within that group yeah yeah but i would add that what you also want to do is you want to um mate with someone who's equivalent in mate value or or has even what's more difficult is has a likely equivalent future mate value trajectory because nothing remains static yes uh as beautiful but it's also the case that there are individual things we haven't talked about these but things like um religious uh orientation political orientation uh values these are extremely important to be compatible on and so you do have cases of let's say a democrat marrying a republican and that sometimes works but you're going to get into a lot of conflict other things being equal or someone who's deeply religious versus someone who is not all religious this is gonna be a problem or someone who's of a different religious faith um and and so uh compatibility on those things compatibility also on personality dimensions i think there's some main effects like so i would i would recommend avoiding that dimension we talked about of emotional instability because if you sign up for that you at least should know you're going to be in for a lot of conflict it may be exciting at times but there's going to be a lot of ups and downs know what you sign up for what about how much to date so there's a culture i'm speaking soon to a founder and long-time ex-ceo of tinder so there's that culture of digitalized dating of swipe right swipe left uh is it positive negative how much did you date yeah what's the number and also what number of sexual partners should you what's optimal asking for a friend i don't know if there's a single uh optimum there um let's hope i think is it is it single digits or double digits i need answers well i don't know i get some of my wisdom from lyrics from uh songs so um uh this uh eagles song i think don henley you know said something like a there are too many lovers in one lifetime ain't good for you or something like that yeah but um you know i think there there is a uh take it easy is a good one too yeah basically don't don't get don't get too attached don't take it don't take heartbreak too seriously yeah so but but i think i mean you know internet dating and you know there's there's been some work on them i think has its pluses and minuses you know i and one of the pluses is it gives you access to potential pools of mates that you could never possibly meet in real life you know where mating and dating used to be either people you knew or friends of friends or you go out to bars or parties but so that's the good thing gives you access to those extended pools but also it gives people the um illusion that there's always someone better out there for you someone who's just a little more attractive a little more compatible a little more and so uh it produces what's sometimes called decision paralysis you know you have too many options and you you can't choose i think one one other potential um negative which i think could be corrected by these internet dating sites is that the picture the photographs uh the of the of the face and body tend to overwhelm all other sources of information and so especially if you're if you're just looking for a sex partner that's one thing physical appearance is it's fine for that to be overwhelmingly important but if you're looking for long-term mate there are so many other things that are really really important and so but but people tend to be uh swamped by the visual input which is natural because that's where we evolved to respond to visual input we're not you've ought to respond to words you know like uh oh i'm i like to go fishing or something like that uh so if there's some way for these sites to in long-term waiting for these other characteristics to be made more salient in people's information processing i think that would be a valuable uh improvement yeah because even forget long-term beauty even sex appeal is is um like even the word appearance it feels like to me people that are super sexy in real life are a lot more than their picture yeah yeah like they're it's actually surprising like they come to life in different ways yes it could be either submissiveness of shyness or ex extravagant um wit and humor or like uh super confident or super like whatever they are the whatever the weirdness that they are comes through immediate so when people say well that was just the case of the uh of sort of proponents of dating apps it's like when you meet somebody at a bar you're getting the same experience as you do on a dating site you have very little information all you get is appearance but i don't think appearance on the screen is the same as appearance in real life especially with people that for some reason you find super sexy because like and again the objectification that we mentioned earlier is the um it over optimizes for people who are good at taking pictures of themselves like they're representing themselves inaccurately they're not just even in the physical features but in the way those physical features are used in physical reality like in terms of body language in terms of flirtation in terms of just everything everything put together so i just um there i i wonder if there's a way to close that uh to close that gap and i don't know what that is exactly i tend to believe more information is good on dating i think i don't use actually dating apps i just because they don't make any sense to me because there's not enough information like what this like uh to me like whether you know dostoevsky you're not as important and i don't mean that because you've read specifically a book by dostoevsky but there's something about have you suffered have you thought about life deeply have you been shaken in some way and that's not sometimes books can reveal that sometimes something else can reveal that but this kind of very shallow resume like i like to travel i have boobs all right it's like this kind of thing is it loses the humanity of it all yeah i want because listen as a fan of technology i would love dating to open up like you said the pool of possibilities out there the soulmate idea like i believe that there's an incredible people out there for you that is an emotional connection not just a physical connection and so that the promise of um digital tech is that you can discover those people and that's not just for romantic relationship it's for friendships it's for business partners it's for all that kind of stuff like your your friend groups but yeah there's something seems broken about dating sites yeah well that's why i mean when i'm asked for advice on this i say if you feel like you have a connection with someone meet them in person you meet them in in real life and because the road trip be like you said yeah stress test it yes yeah because there's only i mean so much you can learn through messaging and so forth amongst all of this we didn't really we didn't really mention love which is hilarious so let me ask you as uh in the last just a few questions what's the role of love in all of this in in the human condition so if um we talked about mating we talked about made selection we talked about all the things we find attractive and inmates the status hierarchies and all that kind of stuff what about that deep connection with the human being that's hard to explain well we talked about it a little bit but so we're talking about love like like romantic love um i think it's an evolved emotion that evolved in part to solidify long-term pair bonds uh and is it different from the love of a parent for a child or or brotherly love or sisterly love or other friendship love i think these are different phenomena but if we're talking about roman romantic love i think it's an evolved emotion um leading hypothesis is that it's a it's a commitment device uh so if i say to a potential mate um oh uh you exceed my minimum thresholds on intelligence and and looks i think we we make a good couple it's a good pickup line yeah it wouldn't um it wouldn't do much um emotionally but if but if you say you know i i love you it's i i can't i can't stop thinking about you i it's this uncontrollable emotion that i feel toward you it's it's a sign that you know um that i'm committed to you uh at least for a while uh and i'm not gonna abandon you when when you know if you're an aide and when an 8.5 comes along i'm not going to drop you and go with the 8.5 yeah it's that's so interesting but that's you know it's still still the reality of the emotion is there however it evolved it's still there and it's interesting it's one of the more puzzling pieces here um even broader than romantic love but in romantic love like what is that uh how much of that is nature how much of it is nurture because even i mean i ask that myself all the time like i'm deeply romantic how much is that is nature how much of it is nurture how much is the the people i spent my childhood with the ideas i mean um the soviet union sort of is known for the literature and the movies and so on that are that are very over they're heavily romanticized i don't want to say over romanticized maybe there's no such thing but so maybe what is that is that my upbringing or is that some somewhere in the genetics um that i value that emotional connection yeah well most humans have the capacity for love you know whether it is um activated in any individual person such as you uh or anyone else it is going to be adjusted or suppressed by different social and cultural and upbringing factors you know i mean there there are cultures where parents basically walk away girls they cloister them and so they can't ever meet anyone else until they the parents arrange to marry him so they they're they override any possibility of um of love um but i i think i think it's an evolved emotion and um i mean one kind of test of this and this is just slightly circumstantial evidence but in china historically there have been arranged marriages and then you know individual choice marriages the arranged marriages tend to have higher breakup rates and lower child production than the ones that are sort of voluntarily chosen you know so i've heard of me sort of contrasting stuff from india i wonder uh contrasting so that where the arranged marriages are longer lasting you know i it's so interesting because you say china yeah i would love to see the data and the dance of that because there's a lot of other interesting factors like how the arranged marriage is arranged yes um is it for the families is the interest of the families for some kind of like in the monarchies to make agreements to trade resources or is the interest of the family to maximize the success of the marriage so compatibility is it are they looking for maximized compatibility are they looking to maximize resources well historically it's often been an arrangement where they're trying to maximize the status and power of the ala of the alliance with this other extended family um but but that also varies from culture to culture like there's the uh the tiwi culture where there's uh you know the the the men basically bestowed the dot their daughters on other men and they they try to gauge which men which of these young up and coming men are really going to be you know chiefs high status guys and which ones are going to be losers and so um you have this weird phenomenon they have polygenic marriage where uh a guy will get one daughter bestowed on him and then other men use that as information uh that this guy must be rising in status and so they give their daughters to the guy as well as have we go from like zero to seven wives and very short stories richer that's fascinating uh the game of thrones uh insects is a part of that game let me ask you about yourself your own self who mentioned richard rangham think about mortality do you think about your own mortality are you afraid of death yeah interesting i'm not afraid of death um i i agree with with richard wrangham i i i'm not eager to leave the party i don't want to leave the party soon i enjoy life um in all of its interesting complexities i enjoy my scientific work i enjoy my relationships with other people i enjoy exploring the universe so i'm not eager to to leave but i'm not afraid of it and i think um part of that is that um i was married for a while and um my wife died uh prematurely uh of cancer and so i spent basically eight months with her watching her diet she after she was diagnosed and there's some weird it's a horrible time for me and for her obviously but there's some way in which it kind of um made it more familiar so that it's uh became a lot less frightening you know um but um how did that experience change you just as a scientist as a thinker about humanity um as a as a human yourself well i guess so you're saying you felt like you felt a little bit more ready for this whole end of the party well yeah it's yeah because we tend to be afraid of things that we're not familiar with you know and so if you're familiar with it um at least in my case that that caused a lessening of um fear on that dimension but i don't know i it also kind of you know there are these existential thoughts that it brought about like how ephemeral life is and um and i remember this richard dawkins quote he said something like um we are all going to die and we're the lucky ones you know uh yeah that we got we even got a chance yeah or or even uh uh you mentioned russian writers one of my favorite writers is uh nabakov vladimir nabakov i don't know if you've read him but he he said once that um life is a chink of light between two eternities of darkness and you're saying that's not terrifying to you well i i'd prefer i'm happy with the prior the first eternity of darkness i prefer the second um not to occur but um but it's going to occur i mean it's um we know that uh um elon musk aside i i i'm skeptical that we'll be colonizing other planets in any substantive way uh and so our our star our sun will will burn out and so it might it's going to take a few billion years or so but um it will eventually the earth will become a cold lump of um dirt floating around in the universe with no life on it so it's not just your light the light of your consciousness it's the light of our human civilization that will eventually go out yes everything at least here i do believe that there is life and intelligent life in other parts of the universe on other planets i sometimes wonder if the second eternal darkness is the thing that makes the light possible so in the other places out there i wonder how successfully can you truly be without the deadline of death both at the human scale and at the civilizational scale i feel like we in order in order to create anything beautiful we have to live at the on the edge of destruction that seems to be um you know some people would say that's just the future of our past that our future can be otherwise but you know like you i'm uh somebody that looks at the data and currently the data says otherwise but uh of course we're constantly changing the data because we're there's change so we'll see what we see i wonder what the future uh future holds for us speaking of which as a you know as somebody who wrote the textbook on evolutionary psychology what do you think is the meaning of the whole thing what's the meaning of life um you're very good at describing how the human mind is the way it is but why is it here at all what's the purpose well i can give you my answer to that but i would actually love to hear your answer because i know you've asked this question of dozens and dozens of people on your podcast and what what are what are your thoughts on that well first of all my mind changes on that at all a lot and i think the process of answering the question is the fun thing not the actual final answer i think the question itself is the most fun thing but for me usually is two things one is love and we can talk a long time what i mean by that is it's not just romantic love and two is to create and hopefully to create beauty so and again i can talk forever what that means for me personally creating beauty means engineering and creating experiences like connection with others on the love side it's just the actual feeling the experience of deep appreciation of um everything around you like the sensory experiences of everything around you just feeling it every single moment saying i'm damn glad to be alive that light with the darkness on your side just being appreciative like being in the in the experience of of truly present and experiencing it because um because it's not going to be there for long the whole thing ends and that that to me is love and the the reason romantic love is so important is um is that other people are just awesome they're fascinating black boxes that can generate awesomeness so can like other animals and objects for me but uh humans in particular for some reason are just generators of awesomeness yes they surprise us yeah yeah and therefore a good target of love well so that's a much more eloquent answer than um than i could give but i'll just say a thought or two um on that and uh i mean one of the things that you know what is the meaning of of life i mean in some sense um if you're thinking about some eternal purpose meaning like if we look five billion years hence you know will any of this mean anything i think the answer to that is probably no okay but and this is i think where my answer would concur with yours is that i think we have a rich evolved psychology that contains many complex adaptations and at any one moment in time most are quiescent most are not activated but for me part of the meaning of life is experiencing the activation of a lot of these complicated evol psychological mechanisms and they include romantic love they include friendship they include being part of a group or coalition because i think we're an intensely coalitional species so there's something about being a group member so like just even i don't know if you're in in sports if your your team wins you feel that somehow that's your part of that um uh and but this goes for both the positive and the and the uh darker sides of things so so for example warfare um you see these men who have been through a war together and who where their lives have depended on each other and they're like best friends for for life and have a bond that is stronger than most people form with a friend ever in their life because they've been through the these life or death experiences and so you know i i wouldn't want to um you know doesn't cause me to want to charge off and be in war but uh but there are some types of adaptations even like warfare adaptations where in principle i would like to experience them i would like to experience and and never will but uh you know what is it like to be in a coalition where you are in combat with another coalition and not not in modern warfare because it's it's you know horrible but where your life is in danger where your life you depend for your life on other people and they're depending for their life on you and there's this kind of coalitional solidarity that is um is unique now um uh another thing that of course i'll never be able to experience this is murder because i'm never gonna murder anybody okay but he's young but studying homicidal ideation really gave me a it wasn't it was an eye-opener it was as interesting as studying sexual fantasies because the if you ask what triggers homicidal thoughts ideation most people have had them uh and uh and i because i asked this question have you ever thought about killing someone and and i get that 91 percent of men say yes about 84 percent of women say no and even when i talk to people they say uh one-on-one they'll say oh no i've never thought of telling someone what kind of person you think i am and then 10 minutes later i say actually there was this one time when i got this guy humiliated me in public and i you know and and so but i think um thoughts about killing um homicide ideation and they're very predictable from an evolutionary perspective if you look like we mentioned mate poachers earlier and uh infidelity and there are other things but uh things like that being humiliated in in public status loss you know do trigger homicidal thoughts so so anyway i don't go off too much on that but i guess what i'm saying in answer to your question is is experiencing the rich array of complex psychology that we have within us most of which remains unactivated and some of which will never be experienced um like you know there are some people who never never experienced love for example because of you know cultural restrictions or or whatever and so uh to me that that's part of the meaning of life so that's that's so beautifully put the saying that they're kind of dormant inactivated aspects of the uh so the psychological mechanism so we have the capacity to experience a bunch of stuff it's almost like in video games you can unlock levels and so on and so this is basically there's all of these things that are dormant in our mind that we have the capacity to experience and part of the meaning is to try to experience um as many of them or uh as many new ones novel for the particular society or maybe the entirety of human civilization who knows psychedelic drugs like you said violence uh experiences that might have to do with brain computer interfaces the interaction with all of those are experiences and so the question is what is the ceiling what are like how uh infinite or nearly infinite is the capacity of the human mind to experience all those things and we'll get to uh we'll get to discover those things so um i'm glad you never got a chance and never will get a chance to murder but i just want to put it on record that you know that's definitely something on my bucket list why do you think i dress like this anyway um there is something appealing like one of my favorite movies is leon the professional oh i love that movie what is that why is that so exciting listen maybe it's the ocd thing like killing other bad guys no women no children women no children also loving that with uh uh natalie porter natalie portman incredible actress uh also the complex whatever that is the fatherly or romantic whatever that is like lolita type of thing i don't know what i i've never like read a phd thesis on that interpretation of that movie but that's a fascinating one violence and violence and love and sex that's what makes uh life worth living that's what makes it fun david you're an incredible person incredible scientist it's a huge honor to share a city with you or i'm i'm the visitor you own this place you run this place oh i don't i we vote we both live here now yeah and uh it's been great talking to you it's a great honor for me um i've mentioned i've followed your podcast for a long long time now and tremendously enjoy your your interviews and you have a very um inquisitive inviting style that brings out things in your guests which i think is fantastic activates all those dormant psychological mechanisms that's what that's a life that's what conversation is all about thank you for talking today thank you thanks for listening to this conversation with david buss to support this podcast please check out our sponsors in the description and now let me leave you with some words from eb white if the world were merely seductive that would be easy if it were merely challenging that would be no problem but i rise in the morning torn between a desire to improve the world and a desire to enjoy the world this makes it hard to plan the day thank you
