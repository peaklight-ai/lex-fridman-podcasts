## Design Philosophy

### Atomic Notes
- Each note focused on one topic
- Sized for readability
- Interconnected rather than comprehensive

### Progressive Disclosure
- README → Cluster MOCs → Episode/Concept Notes → Sub-topics
- Easy entry points, deep exploration possible

### Multiple Access Paths
- By cluster (thematic)
- By episode (chronological/guest)
- By concept (cross-cutting)
- By theme (patterns)
- By tags (filtered)

### Obsidian Native
- Uses wiki-style links `[[note-name]]`
- Leverages graph view
- Tag-based organization
- Backlinks automatic

### Extensible
- Easy to add new episodes
- Template-based structure
- Concept notes consolidate naturally
- MOCs scale with content
