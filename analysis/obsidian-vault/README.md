## Meta-Insights

### The Inflection Point Narrative
All episodes share an underlying theme: **humanity is at a critical juncture** where ancient wisdom meets cutting-edge technology, existential threats meet unprecedented capabilities, and individual freedom confronts collective survival.

### The Pattern of Forbidden Knowledge
From Cantor's infinity to nuclear secrets to CBRN AI risks—transformative knowledge often begins as heresy.

### The Scale Paradox
Episodes grapple with incomprehensible scales: from 6-minute nuclear decisions to 60,000-year human migrations, from infinite mathematics to trillion-parameter AI models.

### Truth as Contested Terrain
Memory is unreliable (Ranganath), media is biased (multiple perspectives), and institutional truth erodes—yet we must navigate reality.
