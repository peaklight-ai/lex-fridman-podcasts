# Scaling Laws

**Domain:** AI, Mathematics, Civilization, Physics
**Status:** Active area of research

---

## Definition

Scaling laws describe predictable relationships between input resources (compute, data, model size) and output capabilities. The principle appears across multiple domains:

**In AI:** Linear increases in compute, data, and parameters produce log-linear improvements in model performance.

**In Civilization:** Energy consumption, population, and technological capabilities scale in predictable patterns (Kardashev Scale).

**In Nature:** Power law distributions (1/f noise) appear across physical and biological systems.

## Cross-Episode Appearances

### [[Episode-452-Dario-Amodei|Episode 452: Dario Amodei (AI Safety)]]

**Context:** Discovery of scaling laws in AI

**Key Points:**
- From speech recognition (2014) to language models
- Linear scaling of compute, data, and model size
- "Every time, we manage to either find a way around or scaling just is the way around"
- SWE-bench: 3% → 50% in 10 months through scaling

**Quote:** "If you extrapolate the curves... it does make you think that we'll get there by 2026 or 2027"

**Critical Insight:** Scaling is not just "making things bigger"—it's discovering how intelligence emerges from computation
