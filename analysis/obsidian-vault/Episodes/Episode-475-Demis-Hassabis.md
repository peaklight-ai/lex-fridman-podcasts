# Episode 475: Demis Hassabis - DeepMind & AGI

## Overview

Demis Hassabis, Nobel Prize winner and CEO of DeepMind, discusses the path to Artificial General Intelligence, breakthrough discoveries like AlphaFold, and his conjecture that any pattern in nature can be efficiently learned. This episode represents one of the most technically sophisticated discussions of AI capabilities and timelines.

**Core Insight:** Intelligence is fundamentally about pattern recognition. If a pattern exists in nature, a classical learning algorithm can discover and model it efficiently. This principle underpins the path to AGI.

## Key Topics

### Scaling Laws & AGI
- [[Scaling-Laws|Scaling Laws]]: Linear scaling of compute, data, and model size produces predictable capability gains
- **Nobel Prize Conjecture:** "Any pattern that can be generated or found in nature can be efficiently discovered and modeled by a classical learning algorithm"
- [[AGI-Timeline|AGI Timeline]]: Prediction of 2026-2027 based on current trajectories
- Connection to [[P-vs-NP|P vs NP]]: Computational complexity and learnable patterns

**Quote:** "If you extrapolate the curves... it does make you think that we'll get there by 2026 or 2027."

**Critical Insight:** Scaling is not just "making things bigger"—it's a fundamental principle about how intelligence emerges from computation.
